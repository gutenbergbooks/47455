<p>
THE WRITER<br />
TO THE READER<br />
</p>


<p>It was in 1893 that John Milton Edwards (who sets
his hand to this book of experiences and prefers using
the third person to overworking the egotistical pronoun)
turned wholly to his pen as a means of livelihood. In
this connection, of course, the word "pen" is figurative.
What he really turned to was his good friend, the Typewriter.</p>

<p>For two years previous to this (to him) momentous
event he had hearkened earnestly to the counsel that
"literature is a good stick but a poor crutch," and had
cleaved to a position as paymaster for a firm of contractors
solely because of the pay envelope that insured
food and raiment. Spare hours alone were spent in his
Fiction Factory. In the summer of 1893, however, when
his evening and Sunday work brought returns that
dwarfed his salary as paymaster, he had a heart to
heart talk with Mrs. John Milton Edwards, and, as a
result, the paymaster-crutch was dropped by the wayside.
This came to pass not without many fears and
anxieties, and later there arrived gray days when the literary
pace became unsteady and John Milton turned
wistful eyes backward in the direction of his discarded
crutch. But he never returned to pick it up.</p>

<p>From then till now John Milton Edwards has
worked early and late in his Factory, and his output
has supported himself and wife and enabled him to
bear a number of other financial responsibilities. There
have been fat years and lean&mdash;years when plenty invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
foolish extravagance and years when poverty compelled
painful sacrifices&mdash;yet John Milton Edwards can
truly say that the work has been its own exceeding great
reward.</p>

<p>With never a "best seller" nor a successful play to
run up his income, John Milton has, in a score and two
years of work, wrested more than $100,000 from the
tills of the publishers. Short stories, novelettes, serials,
books, a few moving picture scenarios and a little verse
have all contributed to the sum total. Industry was
rowelled by necessity, and when a short story must fill
the flour barrel, a poem buy a pair of shoes or a serial
take up a note at the bank, the muse is provided with an
atmosphere at which genius balks. True, Genius has
emerged triumphant from many a Grub street attic, but
that was in another day when conditions were different
from what they are now. In these twentieth century
times the writer must give the public what the publisher
thinks the public wants. Although the element of quality
is a <i>sine qua non</i>, it seems not to be incompatible
with the element of quantity.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this book will be found of interest
to writers, not alone to those who have arrived but also
to those who are on the way. Writers with name and
fame secure may perhaps be entertained, while writers
who are struggling for recognition may discover something
helpful here and there throughout John Milton
Edwards' twenty-two years of literary endeavor. And
is it too fair a hope that the reader of fiction will here
find something to his taste? He has an acquaintance
with the finished article, and it may chance that he has
the curiosity to discover how the raw material was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
taken, beaten into shape and finally laid before his eyes
in his favorite periodical.</p>

<p>John Milton Edwards, in the pages that follow, will
spin the slender thread of a story recounting his successes
and failures. Extracts of correspondence between
him and his publishers will be introduced, and
other personal matters will be conjured with, by way of
illustrating the theme and giving the text a helpful
value. This slender thread of narrative will be broken
at intervals to permit of sandwiching in a few chapters
not germane to the story but <i>en rapport</i> with the work
which made the story possible. In other words, while
life goes forward within the Factory-walls it will not
be amiss to give some attention to the Factory itself,
to its equipment and methods, and to anything of possible
interest that has to do with its output.</p>

<p>And finally, of course John Milton Edwards is not
the author's real name. Shielded by a <i>nom de plume</i>,
the author's experiences here chronicled may be of the
most intimate nature. In point of fact, they will be
helpful and entertaining in a direct ratio with their sincerity
and frankness.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said John Milton Edwards, miserably
uncertain and turning to appeal to his wife, "which
shall it be&mdash;to write or not to write?"</p>

<p>"To write," was the answer, promptly and boldly, "to
do nothing else but write."</p>

<p>John Milton wanted her to say that, and yet he did
not. Her conviction, orally expressed, had all the ring
of true metal; yet her husband, reflecting his own inner
perplexities, heard a false note suggesting the base alloy
of uncertainty.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better think it over?" he quibbled.</p>

<p>"You've been thinking it over for two years, John,
and this month is the first time your returns from your
writing have ever been more than your salary at the
office. If you can be so successful when you are obliged
to work nights and Sundays&mdash;and most of the time with
your wits befogged by office routine&mdash;what could you
not do if you spent ALL your time in your Fiction Factory?"</p>

<p>"It may be," ventured John Milton, "that I could do
better work, snatching a few precious moments from
those everlasting pay-rolls, than by giving all my time
and attention to my private Factory."</p>

<p>"Is that logical?" inquired Mrs. John Milton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, my dear, whether it's logical or not.
We're dealing with a psychological mystery that has
never been broken to harness. Suppose I have the whole
day before me and sit down at my typewriter to write a
story. Well and good. But getting squared away with
a fresh sheet over the platen isn't the whole of it. The
Happy Idea must be evolved. What if the Happy Idea
does not come when I am ready for it? Happy Ideas,
you know, have a disagreeable habit of hiding out.
There's no hard and fast rule, that I am aware, for capturing
a Happy Idea at just the moment it may be most
in demand. There's lightning in a change of work, the
sort of lightning that clears the air with a tonic of inspiration.
When I'm paymastering the hardest I seem
to be almost swamped with ideas for the story mill.
Query: Will the mill grind out as good a grist if it
grinds continuously? If I were sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It stands to reason," Mrs. Edwards maintained
stoutly, "that if you can make $125 a month running
the mill nights and Sundays, you ought to be able to
make a good deal more than that with all the week days
added."</p>

<p>"Provided," John Milton qualified, "my fountain of
inspiration will flow as freely when there is nothing to
hinder it as it does now when I have it turned off for
twelve hours out of the twenty-four."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, my dear," John Milton admitted, "unless
it transpires that my inspiration isn't strong enough
to be drawn on steadily."</p>

<p>"Fudge," exclaimed Mrs. Edwards.</p>

<p>"And then," her husband proceeded, "let us consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
another phase of the question. The demand may fall
off. The chances are that it WILL fall off the moment
the gods become aware of the fact that I am depending
on the demand for our bread and butter. Whenever
a thing becomes absolutely essential to you, Fate
immediately obliterates every trail that leads to it, and
you go wandering desperately back and forth, getting
more and more discouraged until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Until you drop in your tracks," broke in Mrs. Edwards,
"and give up&mdash;a quitter."</p>

<p>"Quitter" is a mean word. There's something about
it that jostles you, and treads on your toes.</p>

<p>"I don't think I'd prove a quitter," said John Milton,
"even if I did get lost in a labyrinth of hard luck. It's
the idea of losing you along with me that hurts."</p>

<p>"I'll risk <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"This is a panic year," John Milton went on, "and
money is hard to get. It is hardly an auspicious time
for tearing loose from a regular pay-day."</p>

<p>John Milton and his wife lived in Chicago, and the
firm for which John Milton worked had managed to
keep afloat by having an account in two banks. When
a note fell due at one bank, the firm borrowed from the
other to pay it. Thus, by borrowing from Peter to pay
Paul, and from Paul to pay Peter, the contractors juggled
with their credit and kept it good. Times were
hard enough in all truth, yet they were not so hard in
Chicago as in other parts of the country. The World's
Columbian Exposition brought a flood of visitors to the
city, and a flood of cash.</p>

<p>"Bother the panic!" jeered Mrs. Edwards. "It won't
interfere with your work. Pleasant fiction is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
soothing than hard facts. People will read all the more
just to forget their troubles."</p>

<p>"I'm pretty solid with the firm," said John Milton,
veering to another tack. "I'm getting twelve hundred
a year, now, with an extra hundred for taking care of
the Colonel's books."</p>

<p>"Is there any future to it?"</p>

<p>"There is. I can buy stock in the company, identify
myself with it more and more, and in twenty or thirty
years, perhaps, move into a brownstone front on Easy
street."</p>

<p>"No, you couldn't!" declared Mrs. Edwards.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why, because your heart wouldn't be in your work.
Ever since you were old enough to know your own mind
you have wanted to be a writer. When you were twelve
years old you were publishing a little paper for boys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was a four-page paper about the size of lady's
handkerchief," laughed John Milton, "and it lasted for
two issues."</p>

<p>"Well," insisted his wife, "you've been writing
stories more or less all your life, and if you are ever a
success at anything it will be in the fiction line. You
are now twenty-six years old, and if you make your
mark as an author it's high time you were about it.
Don't you think so? If I'm willing to chance it, John,
you surely ought to be."</p>

<p>"All right," was the answer, "it's a 'go.'"</p>

<p>And thus it was that John Milton Edwards reached
his momentous decision. Perhaps you, who read these
words, have been wrestling soulfully with the same question&mdash;vacillating
between authorship as a vocation or as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
an avocation. Edwards made his decision eighteen years
ago. At that time conditions were different; and it is
doubtful whether, had he faced conditions as they are
now, he would have decided to run his Fiction Factory
on full time.</p>

<blockquote class="bbox">

<p class="center">"<b>An eye for an eye.</b>"</p>

<p>A writer whose stories have been used in the Munsey
publications, <i>Pearson's</i> and other magazines, writes:</p>

<p>"How is this as an illustration of timeliness, or the
personal element in writing?&mdash;I went in to see Mr. Matthew
White, Jr., one day with a story and he said he
couldn't read it because he had a sore eye. I had an
eye for that eye as fiction, so I sat down and wrote a
story in two hours' time about an editor who couldn't
read any stories on account of his bum lamp, whereby
he nearly missed the best story for the year. Mr.
White was interested in the story mainly because he
had a sore eye himself and was in full sympathy with
the hero. I took the story down and read it aloud to

<p><i>The Bookman</i>, somewhere, tells of a lady in the Middle
West who caught the fiction fever and wrote in
asking what price was paid for stories. To the reply
that "$10 a thousand was paid for good stories" she
made written response: "Why, it takes me a week to
write one story, and $10 for a thousand weeks' work
looks so discouraging that I guess I'd better try something
else."</p>

<p>
AS THE TWIG<br />
IS BENT<br />
</p>


<p>Edwards' earliest attempt at fiction was a dramatic
effort. The play was in three acts, was entitled "Roderigo,
the Pirate Chief," and was written at the age of 12.
The young playwright was Roderigo, the play was given
in the loft of the Edwards barn, and twenty-five pins
was the price of admission (thirty if the pins were
crooked). The neighborhood suffered a famine in pins
for a week after the production of the play. The juvenile
element clamored to have the performance repeated,
but the patrons' parents blocked the move by bribing the
company with a silver dollar. It was cheaper to pay
over the dollar than to buy back several thousand pins
at monopoly prices.</p>

<p>In 1881 "Simon Girty; or, The Border Boys of the
West" was offered. The first performance (which was
also the last) was given in Ottawa, Kansas, and the modest
fee of admission was 5 cents. The play was very
favorably received and might have had an extended run
had not the mothers of the "border boys" discovered
that they were killing Indians with blank cartridges.
Gathering in force, the mothers stormed the barn and
added a realistic climax to the fourth act by spanking
Simon Girty and disarming his trusty "pards."</p>

<p>Shortly after this, the musty records show that Edwards
turned from the drama to narrative fiction, and
endeavored successfully to get into print. The following,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
copied from an engraved certificate, offers evidence
of his budding aspirations:</p>

<p class="center">

This is to certify that John Milton Edwards,<br />

Mention for excellence in literary composition.<br />
New York, Oct. 30, 1882.      <span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 3em;">Frank Leslie.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This "honorable mention" from the publisher of a
paper, which young Edwards looked forward to from
week to week and read and re-read with fascination and
delight, must have inoculated him for all time with the
fiction virus. Forthwith he began publishing a story
paper on a hektograph. Saturday was the day of publication,
and the office of publication was the loft of the
Edwards' barn. Even at that early day the author understood
the advantage of holding "leave-offs"<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> in serial
work. He was altogether too successful with his leave-offs,
for his readers, gasping for the rest of the story
and unable to wait for the next issue of the paper,
mobbed the office and forced him, with a threat of dire
things, to tell them the rest of the yarn in advance of
publication. After that, of course, publication was unnecessary.</p>

<p>It was a problem with young Edwards, about this
time, to secure enough blank paper for his scribbling
needs. Two old ledgers, only partly filled with accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
fell into his hands, and he used them for his callow
essays at authorship. He has those ledgers now,
and derives considerable amusement in looking through
them. They prove that he was far from being a prodigy,
and reflect credit on him for whipping his slender talents
into shape for at least a commercial success in later life.
Consider this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Scene III.</p>

<p>J. B.&mdash;We made a pretty good haul that time, Jim.</p>

<p>B. J.&mdash;Yes, I'd like to make a haul like that every night.
We must have got about $50,000.</p>

<p>J. B.&mdash;Now we will go and get our boots blacked, then go
and get us a suit of clothes, and then skip to the West Indies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here a $50,000 robbery had been committed and the
thieves were calmly discussing getting their boots blacked
and replenishing their wardrobe (one suit of clothes between
them seems to have been enough) before taking
to flight. Shades of Sherlock, how easily a boy of 12
makes business for the police department!</p>

<p>Or consider this gem from Act II. The aforesaid
"J. B." and "B. J." have evidently been "pinched"
while getting their boots blacked or while buying their
suit of clothes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>J. B.&mdash;We're in the jug at last, Jim, and I'm afraid we'll
be sentenced to be shot.</p>

<p>B. J.&mdash;Don't be discouraged, Bill.</p>

<p>Enter Sleek, the detective.</p>

<p>Sleek.&mdash;We've got you at last, eh?</p>

<p>J. B.&mdash;You'll never get the money, just the same.</p>

<p>Sleek.&mdash;We'll shoot you if you don't tell where it is like a
dog.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then here's something else which seems to prove that
young Edwards occasionally fell into rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, why cut down those forests,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Our forests old and grand?<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>

<p>John Milton Edwards has always had a place in his
heart for the red man, and another for his country's
vanishing timber. He is to be congratulated on his
youthful sentiments if not on the way they were expressed.</p>

<p>In 1882 the Edwards family removed to Chicago.
There were but three in the family&mdash;the father, the
mother, and John Milton. The boy was taken from the
Ottawa high school and, as soon as they were all comfortably
settled in the "Windy City," John Milton made
what he has since believed to be the mistake of his career.
His father offered him his choice of either a university
or a business education. He chose to spend two
years in Bryant &amp; Stratton's Business College. His literary
career would have been vastly helped had he taken
the other road and matriculated at either Harvard or
Yale. He had the opportunity and turned his back on it.</p>

<p>He was writing, more or less, all the time he was a
student at Bryant &amp; Stratton's. The school grounded
him in double-entry bookkeeping, in commercial law, and
in shorthand and typewriting.</p>

<p>When he left the business college he found employment
with a firm of subscription book publishers, as
stenographer. There came a disagreement between the
two partners of the firm, and the young stenographer
was offered for $1,500 the retiring partner's interest.
The elder Edwards, who would have had to furnish the
$1,500, could not see anything alluring in the sale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
books through agents, and the deal fell through. Two
years later, while John Milton was working for a railroad
company as ticket agent at $60 a month, his old friend
of the subscription book business dropped in on him and
showed him a sworn statement prepared for Dun and
Bradstreet. <i>He had cleared $60,000 in two years!</i> Had
John Milton bought the retiring partner's interest he
would have been worth half a million before he had
turned thirty.</p>

<p>The fiction bee, however, was continually buzzing in
John Milton's brain. He had no desire to succeed at
anything except authorship.</p>

<p>Leaving the railroad company, he went to work for
a boot and shoe house as bill clerk, at $12 a week. The
death of his father, at this time, came as a heavy blow
to young Edwards; not only that, but it brought him
heavy responsibilities and led him seriously to question
the advisibility of ever making authorship&mdash;as he had
secretly hoped&mdash;a vocation. His term as bill clerk was a
sort of probation, allowing the young man time, in leisure
hours, further to try out his talent for fiction. He
was anxious to determine if he could make it a commercial
success, and so justify himself in looking forward
to it as a life work.</p>

<p>The elder Edwards had been a rugged, self-made man
with no patience for anything that was not strictly "business."
He measured success by an honorable standard
of dollars and cents. For years previous to his death he
had been accustomed to see his son industriously scribbling,
with not so much as a copper cent realized from
all that expenditure of energy. Naturally out of sympathy
with what he conceived to be a waste of time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
effort, Edwards, Sr., did not hesitate to express himself
forcibly. On one occasion he looked into his son's room,
saw him feverishly busy at his desk and exclaimed, irascibly,
"Damn the verses!"</p>

<p>Young Edwards' mother, on the other hand, was
well educated and widely read; indeed, in a limited way,
she had been a writer herself, and had contributed in
earlier life to <i>Harper's Magazine</i>. She could see that
perhaps a pre-natal influence was shaping her son's career,
and understood how he might be working out his
apprenticeship. Thus she became the gentle apologist,
excusing the boy's unrewarded labors, on the one hand,
and the father's <i>cui bono</i> ideas, on the other.</p>

<p><i>The Chicago Times</i>, in its Sunday edition, used a
story by young Edwards. It was not paid for but it
was published, and the elder Edwards surreptitiously secured
many copies of the paper and sent them to distant
friends. Thus, although he would not admit it, he
showed his pride in his son's small achievement.</p>

<p>From the boot and shoe house young Edwards went
back to the railroad company again; from there, when
the railroad company closed its Chicago office, he went
to a firm of wholesalers in coke and sewer-pipe; and,
later, he engaged as paymaster with the firm of contractors.
Between the coke and sewer-pipe and the pay-rolls
he wedged in a few days of reporting for <i>The Chicago
Morning News</i>; and on a certain Friday, the last of
February, he got married, and was back at his office
desk on the following Monday morning.</p>

<p>The first story for which Edwards received payment
was published in <i>The Detroit Free Press</i>, Sept. 19, 1889.
The payment was $8.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>In April, the same year, the <i>Free Press</i> inaugurated
a serial story contest. Edwards entered two stories, one
under a <i>nom de plume</i>. Neither won a prize, but both
were bought and published. For the first, published in
1891, he was paid $75 on Feb. 2, 1890; and for the
second, published a year later, he was paid $100.</p>

<p>With the opening installment of the first serial the
<i>Free Press</i> published a photograph of the author over a
stickful of biography. On another page appeared a
paragraph in boldface type announcing the discovery of
a new star in the literary heavens.</p>

<p>The spirit of John Milton Edwards swelled within
him. He feasted his eyes on his printed picture (the
rapid newspaper presses had made a smudge of it), he
read and re-read his lean biography (lean because not
much had happened to him at that time) and he gloried
over the boldface type with its message regarding the new
star (he was to learn later that many similar stars are
born to blush unseen) and he felt himself a growing
power in the world of letters.</p>

<p>Verily, a pat on the back is a thing to conjure with.
It is more ennobling, sometimes, than a kingly tap with
a swordpoint accompanied by the words, "I dub thee
knight." To the fine glow of youthful enthusiasm it
opens broad vistas and offers a glimpse of glittering
heights. Even though that hand-pat inspires dreams
never to be realized, who shall say that a little encouragement,
bringing out the best in us, does not result in much
good?</p>

<p>And in this place John Milton Edwards would make
a request of the reader of fiction. If you are pleased
with a story, kindly look twice at the author's name so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
you may recall it pleasantly if it chances to come again
under your eye. If you are a great soul, given to the
scattering of benefactions, you might even go a little farther:
At the expense of a postage stamp and a little time,
address a few words of appreciation to the author in
care of his publisher. You wist not, my beloved, what
weight of gold your words may carry!</p>

<p>From the summer of '89 to the summer of '93 Edwards
wrote many stories and sketches for <i>The Detroit
Free Press</i>, <i>Puck</i>, <i>Truth</i>, <i>The Ladies' World</i>, <i>Yankee
Blade</i>, <i>Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly</i>, <i>Chatter</i>, <i>Saturday
Night</i>, and other periodicals. In 1890 he was receiving
$10 a month for contributions to a little Chicago
weekly called <i>Figaro</i>; and, during the same year, he
found a market which was to influence profoundly a
decade of work and his monetary returns; James Elverson
paid him $75 for a serial to be used in <i>Saturday
Night</i>.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was this serial that pointed Edwards
toward the sensational story papers. A second serial,
sold to <i>Saturday Night</i>, Oct. 21, 1891, brought $150;
while a third, paid for July 20, 1893, netted a like
amount. These transactions carried the true ring of
commercial success. Apart from myth and fable, there
is no more compelling siren song in history than the
chink of silver. Edwards, burdened with responsibilities,
gave ear to it.</p>

<p>The serial story, published in the <i>Free Press</i> in 1891,
had made friends for Edwards. Among these friends
was Alfred B. Tozer, editor of <i>The Chicago Ledger</i>.
Through Mr. Tozer, Edwards received commissions for
stories covering a period of years. The payment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
$1.50 a thousand words&mdash;modest, indeed, but regular
and dependable.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>From 1889 to 1893 Edwards was laboring hard&mdash;all
day long at his clerical duties and then until midnight
in his Fiction Factory. The pay derived from his fiction
output was small, (<i>the Ladies' World</i> gave him $5
for a 5,000-word story published March 18, 1890, and
<i>The Yankee Blade</i> sent him $13 on Jan. 10, 1891, for a
story of 8,500 words), but Edwards was prolific, and
often two or three sketches a day came through his
typewriter.</p>

<p>Early in 1893, however, he saw that he was at the
parting of the ways. He could no longer serve two
masters, for the office work was suffering. He realized
that he was not giving the contracting firm that faithful
service and undivided energy which they had the right
to expect, and it was up to him to do one line of work
and one only.</p>

<blockquote class="bbox">

<p class="center">"<b>Slips and Tips</b>"</p>

<p>One of Mr. White's authors who had never been in
Europe set out to write a story of a traveller who determined
to get along without tipping. The author described
his traveller's horrible plight while being shown
around the Paris Bastille&mdash;which historic edifice had
been razed to the ground some two centuries before the
story was written! The author received a tip from Mr.
White on his tipping story, a tip never to do it again.</p></blockquote>

<p>
METHODS THAT<br />
MAKE OR MAR.<br />
</p>


<p>Edwards has no patience with those writers who
think they are of a finer or different clay from the rest
of mankind. Genius, however, may be forgiven many
things, and the artistic temperament may be pardoned an
occasional lapse from the conventional. This is advertising,
albeit of a very indifferent sort, and advertising
is a stepping-stone to success. The fact remains that
True Genius does not brand with eccentricity the intelligence
through which it expresses itself. The time has
passed when long hair and a Windsor tie proclaim a man
a favorite of the muses.</p>

<p>Edwards knows a young writer who believes himself
a genius and who has, indeed, met with some wonderful
successes, but he spoils an otherwise fine character by
slovenliness of dress and by straining for a so-called
Bohemian effect. Bohemia, of course, is merely a state
of mind; its superficial area is fanciful and contracted;
it is wildly unconventional, not to say immoral; and no
right-thinking, right-feeling artist will drink at its sloppy
tables or associate with its ribald-tongued habitues. The
young writer here mentioned has been doped and shanghaied.
As soon as he comes to himself he will escape to
more creditable surroundings.</p>

<p>There is another writer of Edwards' acquaintance
who, by profane and blasphemous utterance, seeks to
convince the public that he has the divine fire. His
language, it is true, shows "character," but not of the
sort that he imagines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>A writer, to be successful, must humble himself with
the lowly or walk pridefully with the great. For purposes
of study he may be all things to all men, but let
him see to it that he is not warped in his own self-appraisal.
Never, unless he wishes to make himself
ridiculous, should he build a pedestal, climb to its crest
and pose. If he is worthy of a pedestal the public will
see that it is properly constructed.</p>

<p>A writer is neither better nor worse than any other
man who happens to be in trade. He is a manufacturer.
After gathering his raw product, he puts it through the
mill of his imagination, retorts from the mass the personal
equation, refines it with a sufficient amount of
commonsense and runs it into bars&mdash;of bullion, let us
say. If the product is good it passes at face value and
becomes a medium of exchange.</p>

<p>Any merchant or professional man who conducts his
business with industry, taste and skill is the honorable
and worthy peer of the man who writes and writes well.
Every clean, conscientious calling has its artistic side
and profits through the application of business principles.</p>

<p>Nowadays, for a writer to scribble his effusions in
pale ink with a scratchy pen on both sides of a letter-sheet
is not to show genius but ignorance. If he is a
good manufacturer he should be proud of his product;
and a good idea is doubly good if carefully clothed.</p>

<p>Edwards counts it a high honor that, in half a dozen
editorial offices, his copy has been called "copperplate."
"I always like to see one of your manuscripts come in,"
said Mr. White, of <i>The Argosy</i>. "Here's another of Edwards'
stories," said Mr. Harriman of <i>The Red Book</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
"send it to the composing room just as it is." Such a
condition of affairs certainly is worth striving for.</p>

<p>As a rule the young writer does not give this matter
of neatness of manuscript the proper attention. Is he
careful to count the letters and spaces in his story title
and figure to place the title in the exact middle of the
page? It is not difficult.</p>

<p>When a line is drawn between title, writer's name
and the body of the story, it is easy to set the carriage
pointer on "35" and touch hyphens until you reach "45."
It is easy to number the pages of a manuscript in red
with a bichrome ribbon, and to put the number in the
middle of the sheet. Nor is it very difficult to turn out
clean copy&mdash;merely a little more industry with a rubber
eraser, or perhaps the re-writing of an occasional sheet.</p>

<p>After a manuscript is written, the number of words
computed, and a publication selected wherewith to try
its fortunes, a record should be made. Very early
in his literary career Edwards devised a scheme for
keeping track of his manuscripts. He had a thousand
slips printed and bound strongly into two books of 500
slips each. Each slip consisted of a stub for the record
and a form letter, with perforations so that they could
easily be torn apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Every manuscript was numbered and the numbers,
running consecutively, were placed in the upper right-hand
corners of the stubs. This made it easy to refer to
the particular stub which held the record of a returned
story.</p>

<p>Edwards used this form of record keeping for years.
Even after he came to look upon a form letter with a
manuscript as a waste of effort, he continued to use the
stubs. About the year 1900 card indexes came into
vogue, and now a box of cards is sufficient for keeping
track of a thousand manuscripts. It is far and away
more convenient than the "stub" system.</p>

<p>Each story has its card, and each card gives the manuscript's
life history; title, when written, number of
words, amount of postage required for its going and
coming through the mail, when and where sent,
when returned, when accepted and when paid for, together
with brief notes regarding the story's vicissitudes
or final good fortune. After a story is sold the card
serves as a memorandum, and all these memoranda, totalled
at the end of the year, form an accurate report of
the writer's income.</p>

<p>In submitting his stories Edwards always sends the
serials flat, between neatly-cut covers of tarboard girded
with a pair of stout rubber bands. This makes a handy
package and brings the long story to the editor's attention
in a most convenient form for reading.</p>

<p>With double-spacing Edwards' typewriter will place
400 words on the ordinary 8-1/2 by 11 sheet. Serials of
60,000 words, covering 150 sheets, and even novelettes
of half that length, travel more safely and more comfortably
by express. Short stories, running up to 15&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in rare instances, to 20&mdash;pages are folded twice, inclosed
in a stamped and self-addressed No. 9, cloth-lined
envelope and this in turn slipped into a No. 10 cloth-lined
envelope. Both these envelopes open at the end, which
does not interfere with the typed superscription.</p>

<p>By always using typewriter paper and envelopes of
the same weight, Edwards knows exactly how much
postage a story of so many sheets will require.</p>

<p>In wrapping his serial stories for transportation by
express, Edwards is equally careful to make them into
neat bundles. For 10 cents he can secure enough light,
strong wrapping paper for a dozen packages, and 25
cents will procure a ball of upholsterer's twine that will
last a year.</p>

<p>Another helpful wrinkle, and one that makes for
neatness, is an address label printed on gummed paper.
Edwards' name and address appear at the top, following
the word "From." Below are blank lines for name and
address of the consignee.</p>

<p>In his twenty-two years of work in the fiction field
Edwards has made certain of this, that there is not a
detail in the preparation or recording or forwarding of
a manuscript that can be neglected. Competition is keen.
Big names, without big ideas back of them, are not so
prone to carry weight. It's the <i>stuff</i>, itself, that counts;
yet a business-like way of doing things carries a mute
appeal to an editor before even a line of the manuscript
has been read. It is a powerful appeal, and all
on the writer's side.</p>

<p>Is it necessary to dwell upon the importance of a
carbon copy of every story offered through the mails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
or entrusted to the express companies? Edwards lost
the sale of a $300 serial when an installment of the
story went into a railroad wreck at Shoemaker, Kansas,
and, blurred and illegible, was delivered in New York
one week after another writer had written another installment
to take its place. In this case the carbon copy
served only as an aid in collecting $50 from the express
company.</p>

<p>At another time, when The <i>Woman's Home Companion</i>
was publishing a short serial by Edwards, one
complete chapter was lost through some accident in the
composing room. Upon receipt of a telegram, Edwards
dug the carbon copy of the missing chapter out of his
files, sent it on to New York, and presently received an
extra $5 with the editor's compliments.</p>

Dear Mr. Edwards:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>In regard to the enclosed verse, we would take pleasure
in publishing it, but before doing so we beg to call
your attention to the use of the word "garnish" in
the last line of the first verse, and the second line of the
second. The general idea of "garnish" is to decorate, or
embellish. We say that a beefsteak is "garnished" with
mushrooms, and so it would hardly be right to use the
word in the sense of crowning a poet with a wreath of
bays.</p>

<p>You will pardon us for calling attention to this, but
you know that the most serious verse can be spoiled
by just such a slip, which of course is made without its
character occurring to the mind of the writer.</p>

<p class="sig2">Yours respectfully,</p>

<p>
GETTING "HOOKED UP"<br />
WITH A BIG HOUSE.<br />
</p>


<p>It was during the winter of 1892-3 that Edwards
happened to step into the editorial office of a Chicago
story paper for which he had been writing. His lucky
stars were most auspiciously grouped that morning.</p>

<p>We shall call the editor Amos Jones. That was not
his name, but it will serve.</p>

<p>Edwards found Jones in a very exalted frame of
mind. Before him, on his desk, lay an open letter and
a bundle of newspaper clippings. After greeting Edwards,
Jones turned and struck the letter triumphantly
with the flat of his hand.</p>

<p>"This," he exclaimed, "means ten thousand a year
to Yours Truly!"</p>

<p>He was getting $50 a week as editor of the story
paper, and a sudden jump from $2,600 to $10,000 a year
was sufficiently unsettling to make his mood excusable.
Edwards extended congratulations and was allowed to
read the letter.</p>

<p>It was from a firm of publishers in New York City,
rated up in the hundreds of thousands by the commercial
agencies. These publishers, who are to figure extensively
in the pages that follow, will be referred to as
Harte &amp; Perkins. They had sent the clippings to Jones,
inclosed in the letter, and had requested him to use them
in writing stories for a five-cent library.</p>

<p>Jones' enthusiasm communicated itself to Edwards.
For four years the latter had been digging away, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
humble Fiction Factory, and his literary labors had
brought a return averaging $25 a month. This was excellent
for piecing out the office salary, but in the glow
of Jones' exultation Edwards began to dream dreams.</p>

<p>When he left the editor's office Edwards was cogitating
deeply. He had attained a little success in writing
and believed that if Jones could make ten thousand
a year grinding out copy for Harte &amp; Perkins he could.</p>

<p>Edwards did not ask Jones to recommend him to
Harte &amp; Perkins. Jones was a good fellow, but writers
are notoriously jealous of their prerogatives. After
staking out a claim, the writer-man guards warily
against having it "jumped." Edwards went about introducing
himself to the New York firm in his own way.</p>

<p>At that time he had on hand a fairly well-written,
but somewhat peculiar long story entitled, "The Mystery
of Martha." He had tried it out again and again
with various publishers only to have it returned as "well
done but unavailable because of the theme." This story
was submitted to Harte &amp; Perkins. It was returned,
in due course, with the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="date">New York, March 23, 1893.</p>
<p>
Mr. John Milton Edwards,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Chicago, Ills.</span><br />
<br />
Dear Sir:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>We have your favor of March the 19th together with
manuscript of "The Mystery of Martha," which as it is unavailable
we return to you to-day by express as you request.</p>

<p>We are overcrowded with material for our story paper, for
which we presume you submitted this manuscript, and, indeed,
we think "The Mystery of Martha" is more suitable for book
publication than in any other shape.</p>

<p>The only field that is open with us is that of our various
five and ten cent libraries. You are perhaps familiar with these,
and if you have ever done anything in this line of work, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
should be pleased to have you submit the printed copy of same
for our examination, and if we find it suitable we think we could
use some of your material in this line.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, whom you refer to in your letter, is one of our
regular contributors.</p>

<p class="sig2">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="sig1">Harte &amp; Perkins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here was the opening! Edwards lost no time in
taking advantage of it and sent the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="date">Chicago, March 25, '93.</p>
<p>Messrs. Harte &amp; Perkins, Publishers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">New York City.</span><br />
<br />
Gentlemen:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>I have your letter of the 23d inst. In reply would state
that I have done some writing for Beadle &amp; Adams ("<i>Banner
Weekly</i>") although I have none of it at hand, at present, to
send you. I also am a contributor to "<i>Saturday Night</i>,"
(James Elverson's paper) and have sold them a number of serial
stories, receiving from them as much as $150 for 50,000
words. It is probable that material suitable to the latter periodical
would be out of the question with you; still, I can write
the kind of stories you desire, all I ask being the opportunity.</p>

<p>Inclosed please find Chapter I of "Jack o' Diamonds; or,
The Cache in the Coteaux." Perhaps Western stories are bugbears
with you (they are, I know, with most publishers) but
there are no Indians in this one. I should like to go ahead,
write this story, submit it, and let you see what I can do. I
am able to turn out work in short order, if you should desire
it, and feel that I can satisfy you. All I wish to know is how
long you want the stories, what price is paid for them and
whether there is any particular kind that you need. I have an
idea that the Thrun case would afford material for a good
story. At least, I think I can write you a good one with that
as a foundation. Please let me hear from you.</p>

<p class="sig2">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="sig1">John Milton Edwards.</p></blockquote>

<p>To this Edwards received the following reply, under
date of March 30:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We have your favor of March 25th together with small installment
of story entitled "Jack o' Diamonds." Our careful
reading of the installment leads us to believe that you write
easily, and can probably do suitable work for our Ten-Cent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Library, though the particular scene described in this installment
is one that can be found in almost any of the old time
libraries. It is a chestnut. A decided back number.</p>

<p>What we require for our libraries is something written up-to-date,
with incidents new and original, with which the daily
press is teeming. I inclose herewith a clipping headed, "Thrun
Tells it All," which, used without proper names, might suggest
a good plot for a story, and you could work in suitable action
and incident to make a good tale.</p>

<p>If you will submit us such a story we shall be pleased to examine
same, and if found suitable we will have a place for it at
once. We pay for stories in this library $100; they should contain
40,000 words, and when issued appear under our own <i>nom
de plume</i>.</p>

<p>Installment "Jack o' Diamonds" returned herewith.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus it was up to Edwards to go ahead and "make
good." Such a climax has a weird effect on some
authors. They put forth all their energy securing an
order to "go ahead" and then, at the critical moment,
experience an attack of stage fright, lose confidence
and bolt, leaving the order unfilled.</p>

<p>Years later, in New York, such a case came under
Edwards' observation. A young woman had besieged
a certain editor for two years for a commission. When
the coveted commission arrived, the young woman took
to her bed, so self-conscious that she was under a doctor's
care for a month. The story was never turned in.</p>

<p>Edwards, in his own case, did not intend to put all
his eggs in one basket. He not only set to work writing
a ten-cent library story (which he called "Glim Peters
on His Mettle") but he also wrote and forwarded a
five-cent library story entitled, "Fearless Frank."
"Fearless Frank"&mdash;galloped home again bearing a request
that Edwards make him over into a detective. On
April 15 Edwards received the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>We have your favor of April 13, and note that the insurance
story, relating to Thrun, is nearly completed, and will be forwarded
on Monday next. I hope you have not made the hero
too juvenile, as this would be a serious fault. The stories in the
Ten-Cent Library are not read by boys alone but usually by
young men, and in no case should the hero be a kid, such as we
fear would be your idea of a Chicago newsboy.</p>

<p>We note that you have considered our suggestions, and also
that you will fix up the "Fearless Frank" manuscript with a
view of making it a detective story.</p>

<p>For your information, therefore, we mail you under separate
cover Nos. 2, 11, 15 and 20 of the Five-Cent Library, which
will give you an idea of the character of this detective. We hope
you will give us what we want in both these stories.</p></blockquote>

<p>On April 25 Edwards received a long letter that delighted
him. He was "making good."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have carefully read your story, "Glim Peters on His Mettle,"
and, as I feared, find the same entirely too juvenile for the
Ten-Cent Library, though quite suitable for the Five-Cent
Library, had it not been double the length required. I first considered
the question of asking you to make two stories of it for
this library, but finally decided that this would be somewhat
difficult and unnecessary, as we shall find a place for it later in
the columns of our <i>Boy's Story Paper</i>, to be issued under <i>nom
de plume</i>, and will pay you $75 for same.</p>

<p>The chief point of merit in the story is the excellent and
taking dialogue between Glim Peters, his chum and the detectives.
This boy is a strong character, well delineated and natural. The
incident covered by clairvoyant visits, the scene at the World's
Fair and the Chinese joint experience were all excellent; but the
ghost in the old Willett house, and indeed the whole plot, is
poor. Judging from this story and the previous one submitted,
the plot is your weak point. In future stories make no special
effort to produce an unusual plot, but stick closer to the action
and incident, taken as much as possible from newspapers, which
are teeming with material of this character.</p>

<p>We shall now expect to receive from you at an early date,
the detective story, and to follow this we will forward you material,
in a few days, for a Ten-Cent Library story. We forward
you to-day, under separate cover, several numbers to give
you an idea of the class of story that is suitable for the Ten-Cent
Library. Such scenes in your last story as where Glim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Peters succeeded in buying a mustang and defeated the deacon
in so doing, are just the thing for the Ten-Cent Library; the
same can also be said of the scene in which Meg, the girl in the
bar, stands off the detectives in a vain attempt to save the villains.
That is the sort of thing, and we feel that you will be
able to do it when you know what we want.</p>

<p>I forward you, also, a copy of Ten-Cent Library No. 185,
which I would like you to read, and let me know whether you
could write us a number of stories for this particular series,
with the same hero and the same class of incidents. If so, about
how long would it take you to write 40,000 words? It is possible
I may be able to start you on this series, of which we have
already issued a number.</p></blockquote>

<p>About May 1 Edwards sent the first detective story.
On May 10 he received a letter, of which the following
is an extract:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We are in a hurry for this series (the series for the Ten-Cent
Library) but after you have finished the first one, and during
the time that we are reading it, you can go ahead with the
second detective story, "The Capture of Keno Clark," which, although
we are in no hurry for it, we may be able to use in about
six weeks or two months. You did so well with the first detective
story that I have no doubt you can make the second a satisfactory
one. However, if we find the series for the Ten-Cent
Library O. K., we will want you to write these, one after the
other as rapidly as possible until we have had enough of them.</p>

<p>As to our method of payment, would say that it is our custom
to pay for manuscripts on Thursday following the day of
issue, but, agreeably with your request, we mail you a check tomorrow
in payment of "Glim Peters on His Mettle," and will always
be willing to accomodate you in like manner when you find
it necessary to call upon us.</p></blockquote>

<p>So Edwards made good with the publishing firm of
Harte &amp; Perkins, and for eighteen years there have
been the pleasantest of business relations between them.
Courteous always in their dealings, prompt in their payments
to writers, and eager always to send pages and
pages of helpful letters, Harte &amp; Perkins have grown to
be the most substantial publishers in the country. Is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
because of their interest in their writers? Certainly not
in spite of it!</p>

<p>For them Edwards has written upwards of five hundred
five-cent libraries, a dozen or more serials for their
story paper, many serials for their boys' weekly, novelettes
for their popular magazines, and a large number
of short stories. For these, in the last eighteen years,
they have paid him more than $35,000.</p>

<p>Nor, during this time, was he writing for Harte &amp;
Perkins exclusively. He had other publishers and other
sources of profit.</p>

<blockquote class="bbox">

<p>As an instance of helpfulness that did not help, Edwards
once attempted to come to the assistance of Howard
Dwight Smiley. Smiley wrote his first story, and
Edwards sent it on to <i>The Argosy</i> with a personal letter
to Mr. White. Such letters, at best, can do no more
than secure for an unknown writer a little more consideration
than would otherwise be the case; they will
not warp an editor's judgment, no matter how warmly
the new writer is recommended. The story came back
with a long letter of criticism and with an invitation
for Smiley to try again. He tried and tried, perhaps a
dozen times, and always the manuscript was returned to
the patient Smiley by the no less patient editor. At last
Smiley wrote a story about a tramp who became entangled
with a cyclone. The "whirler," it seems, had
already picked up the loose odds and ends of a farm
yard, along with a churnful of butter. In order to escape
from the cyclone, Smiley's tramp greased himself
with the butter from the churn and slid out of the embrace
of the twisting winds. "Chuck it," said Edwards;
"I'm surprised at you, Smiley." Smiley did "chuck it"&mdash;but
into a mail-box, addressed to Mr. White, and Mr.
White "chucked" a check for $12 right back for it!
Whereupon Smiley chuckled inordinately&mdash;and came no
more to Edwards for advice.</p></blockquote>

<p>
NICKEL THRILLS AND<br />
DOLLAR SHOCKERS.<br />
</p>


<p>The word "sensational" as applied to fiction has been
burdened with an opprobrium which does not rightfully
belong to it. Ignorance and prejudice and hypocrisy
have conspired to defame a very worthy word.</p>

<p>Certain good but misguided people will turn shudderingly
from a nickel novel and complacently look for
thrills in a "best seller." Often and often the "best
seller" is to be had for 95 cents or $1 at the department
stores. Not infrequently it spills more blood than the
nickel thriller, but the blood is spilled on finer paper,
and along with it are idealized pictures of heroine and
hero done by the best artists.</p>

<p>As a matter of course the dollar dreadful is better
done. The author probably took six months or a year
to do it, and if it is well advertised and proves a success
he reaps a modest fortune. On the other hand, the nickel
novel is written in three days or a week and brings the
author $50. Why shouldn't the dollar book show a higher
grade of craftmanship? But is it less vicious than
the novel that sells for five cents? To draw the matter
still finer, is either form of fiction vicious?</p>

<p>If we turn to Webster and seek a definition of "sensational"
we find: "Suited or intended to excite temporarily
great interest or emotion; melodramatic; emotional."</p>

<p>This does not mean that sensational writing is vicious
writing. It is wrong to classify as vicious or degrading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the story of swift action and clean ethics, or to compare
it with that prurient product of the slums which deals
with problems of sex.</p>

<p>The tale that moves breathlessly but logically, that
is built incident upon incident to a telling climax with
the frankly avowed purpose to entertain, that has no
questionable leanings or immoral affiliations&mdash;such a tale
speeds innocently an idle hour, diverts pleasantly the
harrassed mind, freshens our zeal for the duties of life,
and occasionally leaves us with higher ideals.</p>

<p>We are all dreamers. We must be dreamers before
we are doers. If some of the visions that come to us in
secret reverie were flaunted in all their conceit and inconsistency
before the world, not one of us but would
be the butt of the world's ridicule. And yet, out of
these highly tinted imaginings springs the impulse that
carries us to higher and nobler things.</p>

<p>A difference in the price of two commodities does
not necessarily mark a moral difference in the commodities
themselves. <i>The Century Magazine</i> sells for 35
cents, while <i>The Argosy</i> sells for 10 cents. You will be
told that <i>The Century</i> is "high class" and with a distinct
literary flavor, perhaps that it is more elevating. Even
so; yet which of these magazines is doing more to make
the world really livable? Ask the newsdealer in your
town how many <i>Centuries</i> he sells, and how many
<i>Argosies</i>.</p>

<p>Readers are not made for the popular magazines,
but the popular magazines are made for the people.
Unless there was a distinct and insistent demand for
this sort of entertainment, so many all-story magazines,
priced at a dime, could not exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Nickel thrillers cater largely to a juvenile clientele.
Taking them by and large&mdash;there are a few exceptions,
of course&mdash;they are as worthy of readers as the dime
magazines; and many a serial in a dime magazine has
been republished in cloth and made into a "best seller."<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>Why is it that, if a lad in his teens robs a jewelry
store and is apprehended, almost invariably the newspaper
report has a bundle of nickel libraries found in his
pocket? Why a nickel library and not a "yellow" newspaper?</p>

<p>The standard of judgment which places a nickel
novel in the heart-side pocket of the young degenerate,
harks back to a period when "yellow-back" literature
was really vicious; it is a judgment by tradition, unsupported
by present-day facts. The world moves, and as
it moves it grows constantly better. Reputable publishers
of cheap fiction have elevated the character of their
output until now some of the weekly stories they publish
are really admirable; in many instances they are classics.</p>

<p>A few years ago, at a convention of Sunday School
teachers at Asbury Park, N. J., a minister boldly praised
the "Diamond Dick" stories. He declared that while
action rattled through the pages of these tales like bullets
from a Gatling, he had found nothing immoral in
them, nothing suggestive, nothing to deprave. The lawless
received their just reward and virtue emerged triumphant.
It was his thought that a few "Diamond
Dick" stories might, with benefit, take the place, in Sunday
School libraries, of the time-honored book in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the boy goes a-fishing on Sunday and falls into the
river.</p>

<p>One of the "Frank Merriwell" stories tells of a sensitive,
shrinking lad at an academy who was hazed into
a case of pneumonia from which he died. The hero
breaks the news of the boy's death to his widowed
mother and comforts her in her bereavement. From
beginning to end the story is told with a sympathy, and
such a thorough understanding of boy-nature, that the
hold on the juvenile reader is as strong as the theme
is uplifting.</p>

<p>This is not "trash." It is literature sold at a price
which carries it everywhere, and the result is untold
good.</p>

<p>The fact remains, however, that not every publisher
of nickel novels has so high a standard. The paternal
eye, in overseeing the fiction of the young, must be discriminating.
Blood-and-thunder has had its day; but,
if the rising generation is not to be a race of mollycoddles,
care must be exercised in stopping short of the
other extreme.</p>

<p>The life of today sets a pattern for the fiction of to-day.
The masses demand rapid-fire action and good red
brawn in their reading matter. Their awakened moral
sense makes possible the muck-raker; and when they
weary of the day's evil and the day's toil, it is their habit
to divert themselves with pleasant and exciting reading.
And it must be CLEAN.</p>

<p>
MAKING GOOD<br />
BY HARD WORK.<br />
</p>


<p>With the beginning of the year 1894 Edwards was
learning the knack of the nickel novel and its ten-cent
brother, and making good with his New York publishers.
During 1893 the work he turned in was of fair quality,
but he was not satisfied with that and labored to improve.
Each succeeding story came nearer and nearer
the high mark. Believing that whatever is worth doing
is worth doing well, he was constantly asking himself,
"How can I make my next story better than the one I
have just finished?" The publishers helped him. Every
manuscript submitted was read personally by Mr. Perkins,
and brought a letter dissecting the story and stating
which incidents were liked, and why, and which incidents
were not liked, and why. Edwards feels that he
can never be sufficiently grateful to Mr. Perkins for
this coaching in the gentle art of stalking a reader's
elusive interest.</p>

<p>Had Edwards remained a paymaster in the employ
of the contracting firm, he would have received $1,200
for his services in 1893. He severed his connection
with his paymaster's salary in June, and at the end of
the year his Fiction Factory showed these results:</p>

<p>In other words, Edwards had taken out of his Fiction
Factory $625 more than his salary as paymaster
would have amounted to for the year. He felt vastly
relieved, and his wife laughingly fell back on her
woman's prerogative of saying "I told you so." This
was a good beginning, and Edwards felt sure that he
would be able to do even better during 1894. He was
coming along splendidly with the Ten-Cent Library
work. On Jan. 30 Mr. Perkins paid this tribute to his
growing powers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have just finished reading your story, 'Dalton's Double,'
which I find to be as good as anything you have given us. I
must compliment you upon the varied incident which you cram
into these stories, of a nature that is well suited to them."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was Edwards' custom to forward a Ten-Cent Library
story every two weeks, and there were months in
which he wrote three stories, taking ten days for each
one. As these stories were 40,000 words in length,
three in thirty days were equivalent to 120,000 words.</p>

<p>During 1893 he wrote his stories twice: first a
rough draft and then the printer's copy. In 1894 he began
making his first copies clean enough for the compositor.
Had he not done this he could never have accomplished
such a large amount of work.</p>

<p>On April 10, when everything was going swimmingly
and he was taking in $300 a month for the library work,
he was brought up short in his career of prosperity. Mr.
Perkins wrote him to finish the story upon which he
was engaged and then to stop the library work until further
orders. It had been decided to use "re-prints" in
the series. This could very easily be done as the Library
had been published for years and some of the earlier
stories could be brought out again without injuring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
sale. The letter, which was a profound disappointment
to Edwards, closed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I regret the necessity of curtailing your work, for I am entirely
satisfied with it, and if we did not find it necessary to
adopt the measure referred to above, with a view to decreasing
expenses during the summer months and dull season, I should
have wished to have you continue right along. I have no doubt
that you will be able to find a place for your material in the
meantime."</p></blockquote>

<p>This fell upon Edwards like a bolt from a clear sky.
He began to regret his "paymaster crutch" and to
imagine dire things. He had been giving his time almost
exclusively to Harte &amp; Perkins, and had lost touch with
publications for which he had been writing previous to
1893. Where, he asked himself, was he to place his
material in the meantime?</p>

<p>There is little sentiment in business. Harte &amp; Perkins,
whenever they find a line of work is not paying,
will cut it off at an hour's notice, by telegraph if necessary.
The man receiving the telegram, of course, can
only make the best of it. This is a point which Edwards
has always disliked about the work for publishers of this
class of fiction: the writer, no matter how prosperous
he may be at any given time, is always in a state of glorious
uncertainty.</p>

<p>But Edwards fell on his feet. It so happened that
he had sent to Harte &amp; Perkins, some time before,
copies of <i>Saturday Night</i> containing two of his stories.
He had done this in the attempt to prove to them that
he could write for <i>The Weekly Guest</i>, their story paper.
This little incident shows how important it is for a
writer to get as many anchors to windward as possible.</p>

<p>Eight days after being cut off from the library work,
Edwards received a letter from Mr. Harte. Mr. Perkins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
had left New York on business, but had turned over
the printed work in <i>Saturday Night</i> for Mr. Harte's inspection
before leaving. Mr. Harte wrote, in part:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I like your work in <i>Saturday Night</i>, and think we shall be
able to give you a commission for a <i>Weekly Guest</i> story, provided
you can lend yourself successfully to our suggestions as to
style, etc., and give us permission to publish under any of the
pen names we use in the office.</p>

<p>We want a story of the Stella Edwards type. We send you
to-day one or two samples of the class of work desired, so that
you may be able to see just what it is. If you can do the work,
we shall be pleased to send you a title and plot, with synopsis.
You can then write us two installments for a trial, and, if satisfactory,
I have no doubt we could arrange to give you a quantity
of work in this line.</p>

<p>I feel, after reading the samples you submitted, that you will
be able to meet our requirements in this class of story. The
two stories we send you are the work of a masculine pen, and
though not so easy to lose one's identity in literary work, this
class of story does not seem to present the ordinary difficulties;
at least, that is the testimony of our authors who have tried it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Edwards was booked to attempt a gushing love story,
to follow a copy and make it appear as though a woman
had done the writing! Quite a jump this, from a rapid-fire
Ten-Cent Library story for young men to a bit of
sentimental fiction for young women. However, he
went at it, and he went at it with a determination to
make good. It was either that or go paymastering
again.</p>

<p>On April 24 he received title, synopsis and plot of
"Bessie, the Beautiful Blind Girl," and began charging
himself with superheated sentiment preparatory to beginning
his work. The popular young lady authoress,
"Stella Edwards," whose portrait in a decollete gown
had been so often flaunted in the eyes of "her" public,
was a myth. The "stuff" supposedly written by the
charming "Stella Edwards" was ground out by men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
were versatile enough to befool women readers, with a
feminine style. Edwards, it transpired, was able to do
this successfully for a time, but ultimately he failed to
round off the rough corners of a style too decidedly
masculine for "Miss Edwards." But this is anticipating.</p>

<p>On May 3 he had sent the two trial installments, and
from New York came the word:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We like the two opening installments of 'Bessie, the Beautiful
Blind Girl.' The style is good, the action brisk and sensational
and of a curiosity-arousing character.</p>

<p>It is our belief that you are capable of presenting a desirable
variation from the former Stella Edwards' stories, by introducing
romantic incidents of a novel and more exalted character.</p>

<p>In most of the other Stella Edwards' yarns there was little
plot and the action was rarely varied. The action comprised the
pursuit and capture, the recapture and loss of the heroine, she
being constantly whirled, like a shuttle-cock, from the hero to
the villain, then to the female villain, then back again to the
hero for a few tantalizing moments, and so on to the end.</p>

<p>You can readily improve upon this by introducing scenes a
little more fresh, and far more interesting.</p>

<p>It is about time for Stella to improve, and we believe you
are just the man to make her do better work.</p>

<p>Go on with the story and force our readers to exclaim,
'Well, that's the best story Stella has written!'"</p></blockquote>

<p>While Edwards was deep in the sorrows of "Bessie,
the Beautiful Blind Girl," he received from his publishers
on May 10 orders which hurled him headlong into
another "Stella Edwards" yarn.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Owing to a change in our publishing schedule of Guest
stories, it will be necessary to anticipate the issue of 'Bessie, the
Beautiful Blind Girl' by another story of the same type, sixteen
installments, same as the one you are now working on. The
title of this new story will be 'The Bicycle Belle,' and will deal
with the bicycle as the matter of central interest in the first installment
or two. I send you a synopsis of the story prepared by
one of our editors. This will simply give you an idea of one
way of developing the theme. It does not, however, suit our
plans, and we will ask you to invent something quite different."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Always and ever Harte &amp; Perkins kept their fingers
on the pulse of their reading public. The safety bicycle
was the fashion, in those days, and Harte &amp; Perkins
were usually first to exploit a fashion or a fad in their
story columns. Whenever they had a story with a particularly
popular and striking theme, it was their habit
to flood the country with sample copies of <i>The Weekly
Guest</i>, breaking off a generous installment of the serial
in such a breathless place that the reader was forced to
buy succeeding issues of the <i>Guest</i> in order to get the rest
of the story. So that is what the change in their publishing
schedule meant. They wanted to boom the circulation
of the <i>Guest</i> with a bicycle story.</p>

<p>Edwards shelved Bessie the beautiful at the 7th installment
and threw himself into the tears, fears and
chivalry of "The Bicycle Belle." This was on May 12.
Three days later, on May 15, he forwarded two installments
of the bicycle story for Harte &amp; Perkins' inspection.
On May 16, before these installments had reached
the publishers, Edwards was requested as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As we shall not be able to begin, in the Guest, your story,
'Bessie, the Beautiful Blind Girl,' until after January the first,
next, it will be well to change the scene to a winter setting. This
can be very easily done in the two installments that we have on
hand, if you will make a note of it and keep it up for the balance
of the story. In the first installment we will show the girl
leaping into the river with a few cakes of ice floating about,
and in the scene where she is expelled from the house there will
be plenty of snow. It will make a more effective picture and be
more seasonable for the story."</p></blockquote>

<p>More trouble! Harte &amp; Perkins had two installments,
and did not seem to know that Edwards had five
more installments on hand, pending the completion of
the bicycle yarn. But he was ready to turn summer into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
winter, or day into night, in order to make good. On
May 18 he received a report on the two installments of
the bicycle story.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The two installments of 'The Bicycle Belle' have been read
and approved by our editor, who says that the story opens very
well, with plenty of animated action, briefly yet graphically pictured.
You seem to have caught our idea exactly, and we would
be pleased to have you go ahead with the story, finishing it before
you again take up 'Bessie, the Beautiful Blind Girl.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>On June 3 Edwards sent installments three to sixteen
of the bicycle story, which was the complete manuscript.
Ten days later he was informed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'The Bicycle Belle' is crowded with dramatic action and is
just what we want. In the next it would be well to have a little
more of the female element just to demonstrate that 'Stella Edwards'
is up-to-date."</p></blockquote>

<p>None the less pleasant was this news, contained in a
letter dated June 18:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have placed to your credit, upon our books, the sum of
three hundred dollars in payment for 'The Bicycle Belle,' which
will be the figure for all this class of stories from your pen
which are accepted for <i>The Weekly Guest</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Up to that time this was the most money Edwards
had ever received for a serial story, and very naturally
he felt elated. Under date of June 20 he wrote Harte
&amp; Perkins and told them that he was planning a trip East
as soon as he had finished with "Bessie, the Beautiful
Blind Girl." He received a cordial invitation from the
publishers to come on as soon as possible as they had
something which they particularly wanted him to do for
them.</p>

<p>The story of the blind girl was forwarded on June
30. A flaw was discovered in it and several installments
were returned for correction&mdash;not a serious flaw, indeed,
but one which necessitated a little revision. The revision
made, the story passed at once to acceptance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>In July Edwards was in New York and called
personally upon Harte &amp; Perkins. He found them pleasant
and capable gentlemen&mdash;all that his fancy had pictured
them through months of correspondence. Inasmuch
as it was Edwards' first visit to the metropolis, he
studied the city with a view to using it in some of his
fiction.</p>

<p>The special work which Mr. Harte wanted Edwards
to do for the firm was a story of which he gave the salient
features. It was to be written in the best Archibald
Clavering Gunter style.</p>

<p>As Edwards had imitated successfully the mythical
"Stella Edwards," he was now confronted with the more
trying task of imitating the style of a popular living
author. He read Gunter from "Barnes of New York"
down; and then, when completely saturated with him,
turned off two installments of "The Brave and Fair"
and sent them on. He was visiting in Michigan, at the
time, and a letter under date of August 20, reached him
while he was still in that state.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have just finished reading the two installments of 'The
Brave and Fair.' I think you have made a very good opening
indeed. It reads smoothly and seems to me to be very much in
Gunter's light narrative style, which is what we are after. It
remains to be seen whether you can get as close to Gunter in
what might be called his tragedy vein as opposed to the comedy
vein, which you have successfully worked up in these two installments."</p></blockquote>

<p>"The Brave and Fair," going forward to the publishers
piece by piece, seemed to arouse their enthusiasm.
"We have read up to installment eight. It is fine! Full
of heroic action! Bristling with exciting scenes!"
When the completed manuscript was in the publishers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
hands, on October 20, there came another complimentary
letter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'The Brave and Fair' bristled with exciting action to the
close.</p>

<p>The best incidents in it are those descriptive of Chub Jones'
heroic self-sacrifice. In our opinion, this stands out as the gem
of the story, because it makes the reader's heart bound with admiration
for the little hero."</p></blockquote>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of sample copies of <i>The
Weekly Guest</i>, with first chapters of this story, were
scattered all over the land. Later, the book was issued
in paper covers. Harte &amp; Perkins paid the author $500
for the story, then ordered another of the same type for
which he was given $450.</p>

<p>These stories were written under a <i>nom de plume</i>
which Harte &amp; Perkins had copyrighted. The <i>nom de
plume</i> was their property and could not be appropriated
by any other publisher. Edwards wrote three of the
yarns, and a friend of his wrote others.</p>

<p>All the year Edwards had been patted on the back.
On Dec. 14 came a blow between the eyes. He had
been commissioned to write another "Stella Edwards"
rhapsody, but was overconfident and did not take time
to surround himself with the proper "Stella Edwards"
atmosphere. Two installments went forward, and this
letter came back:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have just finished reading 'Two Hearts Against the
World.' I regret to say that the story will not do, and it would
be as well for you not to attempt to remodel it. In other words,
the way you are handling the subject is not satisfactory to us
and is not a question of minor detail. We shall be obliged to
give this work into other hands to do. The story, as far as it
goes, is wildly improbable and has a lack of cohesion in the incident.
I think you wrote it hurriedly, and without mature
thought. These stories have to seem probable even if they deal
with unusual events."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>There was bitterness in that, not so much because
Edwards had lost $300 but because he had failed to
make good. His pride suffered more than his pocket.
Later, however, he wrote some more "Stella Edwards"
stories for Harte &amp; Perkins and they were highly
praised; but that type of fiction was not his forte.</p>

<p>The year 1894 closed with Harte &amp; Perkins giving
Edwards a chance at a new five-cent weekly they were
starting. It was merely a shift from <i>The Weekly Guest</i>
back to the libraries again.</p>

<p>His work for Harte &amp; Perkins, during the year,
showed as follows:</p>

By industry alone Edwards had secured a fair
income.</p>

<p>W. Bert Foster, a friend of Edwards', who for
twenty-five years has kept a story-mill of his own busily
grinding with splendid success, has this to say about a
slip he once made in his early years:</p>

<p>"When I was a young writer I sold a story to a juvenile

<p>
INSPIRATION<br />
ALIAS INDUSTRY.<br />
</p>


<p>Jack London advises authors not to wait for inspiration
but to "go after it with a club." Bravo! It is not
intended, of course, to lay violent hands on the Happy
Idea or to knock it over with a bludgeon. Mr. London
realizes that, nine times out of ten, Happy Ideas are
drawn toward industry as iron filings toward a magnet.
The real secret lies in making a start, even though it
promises to get you nowhere, and inspiration will take
care of itself.</p>

<p>There's a lot of "fiddle-faddle" wrapped up in that
word "inspiration." It is the last resort of the lazy
writer, of the man who would rather sit and dream than
be up and doing. If the majority of writers who depend
upon fiction for a livelihood were to wait for the spirit
of inspiration to move them, the sheriff would happen
along and tack a notice on the front door&mdash;while the
writers were still waiting.</p>

<p>More and more Edwards' experience, and the experience
of others which has come under his observation,
convinces him that inspiration is only another name for
industry. When he was paymaster for the firm of contractors,
he went to the office at 8 o'clock in the morning,
took half an hour for luncheon at noon, and left for
home at half-past 5. When he broke away from office
routine, he promised himself that he would give as much,
or more, of his time to his Fiction Factory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>What he feared was that ideas would fail to come,
and that he would pass the time sitting idly at his typewriter.
In actual practice, he found it almost uncanny
how the blank white sheet he had run into his machine invited
ideas to cover it. After five, ten or fifteen minutes
of following false leads, he at last hit upon the right
scent and was off at a run. With every leap his enthusiasm
grew upon him. A bright bit of dialogue would
evoke a chuckle, a touch of pathos would bring a tear, an
unexpected incident shooting suddenly out of the tangled
threads would fill him with rapture, and for the logical
but unexpected climax he reserved a mood like Caesar's,
returning from the wars and celebrating a triumph.</p>

<p>In the ardor of his work he forgot the flight of time.
He balked at leaving his typewriter for a meal and went
to bed only when drowsiness interfered with his flow of
thought.</p>

<p>Whether he was writing a Five-Cent Library, a serial
story or a novel which he hoped would bring him fame
and fortune, the same delight filled him whenever he
achieved a point which he knew to be worth while. And
whenever such a point is achieved, my writer friend,
there is something that rises in your soul and tells you of
it in words that never lie.</p>

<p>No matter what you are writing, unless you can thrill
to every detail of excellence in what you do, unless you
can worry about the obscure sentence or the unworthy
incident until they are sponged out and recast, it is not
too much to say that you will never succeed at the writing
game. Love the work for its own sake and it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
bring its inspiration and its reward; look upon it as a
grind and melancholy failure stalks in your wake.</p>

<p>There can be no inspiration without industry, and no
industry without inspiration. Start your car on the batteries
of industry and it will soon be running on the magneto
of inspiration. Drive yourself to your work, and
presently interest will be aroused and your eager energies
will need a curb instead of a spur.</p>

<p>Edwards has written two 30,000-word stories a week
for months at a time; he has written one 30,000-word
story and one 40,000-word serial in one week; he has begun
a Five Cent Library story at 7 o'clock in the morning
and worked the clock around, completing the manuscript
at 7 the next morning; and he has done other
things that were possible only because industry brought
inspiration, and inspiration takes no account of time.</p>

<p>Edwards knows a writer of short stories who is like
a crazy man for days while he is frantically groping for
an idea. When the idea comes, he figuratively sweats
blood for a week in pulling it through his typewriter;
and then, when the story is in the mails, he takes to his
bed for a week from physical exhaustion. Result:
Three weeks, one story, and anywhere from $50 to $75.
He is conscientious, but his method is wrong. Instead
of storming through the house and tearing his hair while
the idea eludes him, he should roll in a fresh sheet, sit
calmly down in front of the keys, look out of the window
or around the room and start off with the first object
that appeals to him.</p>

<p>There are writers who will have a Billikin for inspiration,
or some other fetich that takes the place of a Billikin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Edwards has an elephant tobacco-jar that has occasionally
helped him. Sometimes it is a pipeful of the
elephant's contents, and sometimes it is merely a long
look at the elephant that starts the psychology to working.</p>

<p>Of course it isn't really the Billikin, or the elephant,
or the tobacco that does the trick. They merely enable
us to concentrate upon the work in hand: from them we
gather hope that work will produce results, so we get
busy and results come.</p>

<p>The main thing is to break the shackles of laziness
and begin our labors; then, after that, to forget that we
are laboring in the sheer joy of creation with which our
labor inspires us.</p>

My dear Mr. Edwards:<br />

<p>You fairly have me stumped. With the greatest pleasure
in the world I would give you what you ask for
your book, but I am not certain that I can recall any
humorous anecdotes; and as for "quips," I look the word
up and discover that it means: "A sneering or mocking
remark; gibe; taunt." And I am afraid I am not equal
to evolving any of these.... All I can recall now is
that in my early days an editor of the <i>New York Herald</i>
wanted to kick me down the editorial stairs because
I asked pay for amusement notes they had been printing
for nothing. I fled, leaving my last Ms. behind
me&mdash;which they also printed gratis. Now this wasn't
humorous to anybody at the time, and if there was any
'quip,' that editor uttered it, and I don't remember now
just the language he used.</p>

<p>
THE WOLF ON<br />
THE SKY-LINE.<br />
</p>


<p>For Edwards, the year 1895 dawned in a blaze of
prosperity and went out in the gathering shadows of impending
disaster.</p>

<p>Spring found him literally swamped with orders, and
he tried the experiment of hiring a young man stenographer
and typist to assist him. The young man was an
expert in his line and proved so efficient an aide that
Edwards hired another who was equally proficient.
Two stenographers failing to help him catch up with his
flood of orders, he secured a third.</p>

<p>One assistant put in his time copying manuscripts and
cataloguing clippings, to another the library work was
dictated, and the third was employed on "Stella Edwards"
material.</p>

<p>Edwards was versatile, and he experienced no difficulty
in passing from one class of work to another. He
was able to chronicle the breathless adventures of the
hero of the Five-Cent Library to one stenographer, then
turn to the other and dictate two or three chapters of a
serial of the class written by Laura Jean Libby, and then
fill in the gaps between dictation with altogether different
work on his own machine.</p>

<p>Although Edwards kept these three stenographers
for several months, and although he has since frequently
availed himself of the services of an amanuensis, yet he
is free to confess that he doubts the expediency of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
help. Successful dialect cannot be wrapped up in a
stenographer's "pothooks," and so much dialect was used
in the library stories that the young man at work on them
had to familiarize himself with the contorted forms and
write them down from memory. It took him so long to
do this, and required so much of Edwards' time making
corrections, that the profit on his work was disappointing.</p>

<p>With such an office force grinding out copy, during
the early months of 1895 the Fiction Factory was a very
busy place. During January and February the cash returns
amounted to $1,500. This, Edwards discovered
later, was no argument in favor of stenographer assistance,
for he has since, working alone, earned upward of
$1,000 in a month.</p>

<p>In February Edwards was requested by Harte &amp; Perkins
to submit a story for a new detective library which
they were starting, and of which they were very choice.
The work was as different as possible from the two or
three detective yarns Edwards had written in 1893. He
wrote and submitted the story, and Mr. Perkins' criticisms
are given below by way of showing how carefully
the stories were examined. The letter from which the
excerpt is taken was written Feb. 13, 1895. The mythical
detective, who has become known throughout the
length and breadth of the land, shall here be referred to
as "Joe Blake."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is one point to which I would call your attention.
On page 5, Chapter II opens in this way: 'A young man to see
Dr. Reynolds; no card.' Joe Blake, otherwise 'Dr. Reynolds,'
told the boy to show the visitor in. The place was Chicago.
Scene in room in prominent hotel the second day after Joe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Blake had had an interview with Abner Larkin, 9 o'clock in the
evening.</p>

<p>This is too trite and not easily expressed. Such references
to time, place, etc., impress the reader with the fact that he is
reading a romance and not a real story of Joe Blake's experiences.
This particular point should be kept in mind. We want
these stories to appear as natural as possible.</p>

<p>In the opening of the installment, where Mr. Larkin presents
himself to Joe, you have duplicated the common-place
method of most writers. There should be more originality in
the way Joe Blake's attention is called to various cases and not a
continual repetition of calls at his office, which, though natural
enough, become tiresome to the reader. In this same opening
there is not enough detective flavor, and here, as well as in
other places, Joe does not appear to be the man of authority,
which he is usually found to be. These are little things, but I
believe if you will take care of them they will help the story
greatly."</p></blockquote>

<p>This will illustrate the care with which Harte &amp; Perkins
looked over the manuscripts submitted to them, to
the end that they might be made to reflect their ideas of
what good manuscripts should be. If a writer could not
do their work the way they wanted it done he was not
long in getting his <i>conge</i>. In the case of the story mentioned
above, it was returned, rewritten, and made to
conform to Mr. Perkins' ideas.</p>

<p>On Jan. 9 Harte &amp; Perkins had written Edwards:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is more than apparent that the library business is not
very flourishing, and hereafter we shall only be able to pay $40
for these stories. I think this will be satisfactory to you, for I
know you can do this class of work very rapidly."</p></blockquote>

<p>This meant a loss of $10 a week, and Edwards endeavored
to make up for it by increasing his output.
Particularly he wanted a chance to write another "Stella
Edwards" story, just to show the firm that he could do
the work. Mr. Harte gave him an order for the serial,
stating that the new story was to follow "The Bicycle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Belle," then running in <i>The Weekly Guest</i>. The story
was to be in twelve installments of 5,250 words each, totalling
some 63,000 words. For this Edwards was to
receive $200. This hint was given him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Have plenty of romance, without too great extravagance,
and make sure of at least one wedding and that in the beginning
of the story."</p></blockquote>

<p>With the order came a picture which it was desired
to use in illustrating the opening installment. Edwards
was to write the installment around the picture. He
completed the story, called it "Little Bluebell," and received
the following commendation after two installments
had been received and read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have just finished reading the first two installments of
your story, 'Little Bluebell,' and I have to say that the same is
entirely satisfactory, unquestionably the best thing you have
given us in this line of work."</p></blockquote>

<p>Although he was turning out Five-Cent Libraries,
Stella Edwards serials, short sketches for <i>Puck</i> and stories
for other publishers than Harte &amp; Perkins, Edwards
was constantly on the alert for more work in order to
keep his stenographers busy. He asked Mr. Perkins for
orders for the Ten-Cent Library, and for juvenile serials
for the boys' paper. He was allowed to send in some
"Gentlemen Jim" stories for the dime publication. The
pay was not munificent, however, being only $50 for 37,000
words.</p>

<p>The "Little Bluebell" story was followed by another
"Stella Edwards" serial entitled "A Weird Marriage."
This yarn hit the bull's-eye with a bang. In fact, it was
said to be the best thing ever done by "Stella Edwards."
And then, after scoring these two successive hits, Edwards
tripped on a third story called "Beryl's Lovers,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and he fell so hard that it was ten years before the firm
ever asked him to do any more writing in that line.</p>

<p>In the Fall of 1895 Edwards discovered that he had
been working too hard. A doctor examined his lungs,
declared that he was threatened with tuberculosis and
ordered him to the Southwest. In November he and his
wife left Chicago, Edwards carrying with him his typewriter
and a plentiful supply of typewriter paper. He
transformed a stateroom in the compartment sleeper into
his Fiction Factory, finishing two installments of the
ill-fated "Beryl's Lovers" while enroute.</p>

<p>These installments, forwarded from Phoenix, Arizona,
by express, went into a wreck at Shoemaker,
Kansas, and were delivered to Harte &amp; Perkins, torn and
illegible, two weeks after the story had been taken over
by another writer. Edwards filed a claim against the
express company for $300, and then compromised for
$50&mdash;all the express people were liable for by the terms
of their receipt.</p>

<p>From November, 1895, until April, 1896, Edwards was
located on a ranch near Phoenix, Arizona, writing Five-Cent
Libraries for Harte &amp; Perkins and sketches and
short stories for other publishers. His health was steadily
declining, and he could bring himself to his work
only by a supreme effort of the will and at the expense
of much physical torture. In May, 1896, he was told
that he must get farther away from the irrigated districts
around Phoenix and into the arid hills. To this
end he interested himself in a gold mine, and went East
to form a company and secure the necessary capital to
purchase and develop it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>About the middle of July he returned to Phoenix, still
writing but hoping for golden rewards from the mining
venture which would ultimately make his writing less of
a business and more of a pastime.</p>

<p>His health continued to decline and he was ordered
to give up writing entirely and exercise constantly in the
open. He at once telegraphed Harte &amp; Perkins to this
effect. On Oct. 13 they wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have heard nothing from you since receipt of your
telegram to take all work out of your hands. This, of course,
we attended to at once, but on your account, as well as our own,
we were very sorry to learn that you found it necessary to give
up the work, and trust that the illness from which you are suffering
will not be lasting.... If, in future, you should be able
to write again, we shall try to find a place for your work."</p></blockquote>

<p>So the old firm and Edwards parted for a time. A
few weeks proved the mining venture a failure, and $10,000
which Edwards had put away out of the profits of
his writing had vanished&mdash;gone to make the failure memorable.
Nor had his health returned.</p>

<p>In some desperation, just before New Year's of '97,
Mr. and Mrs. Edwards entrained for New York, Edwards
pinning his hopes to Harte &amp; Perkins. He had
less than $100 to his name when he and his wife reached
the metropolis.</p>

<p>One hundred dollars will not carry a man and his
wife very far in New York, even when both are in good
health and the man can work. Ambition alone kept Edwards
alive and gave him hope for the future.</p>

<p>For cold brutality perhaps the rejection slip worded
as below is unequalled:</p>

<p>Before Mr. Karl Edwin Harriman, of The Red Book,
had ventured into the editorial end of the writing trade,
he wrote an article on an order from a certain Eastern
magazine. Later, that magazine decided that it could not
use the article, although it had been paid for, and, with
Mr. Harriman's permission, turned it over to an agent to
market elsewhere.</p>

<p>The agent, not knowing Mr. Harriman had associated
himself with a certain magazine, sent the manuscript to
that publication, in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>It was up to Mr. Harriman, then, to consider it in an
editorial capacity. He was unable to purchase the manuscript,
and returned it to the agent with a reproof for
having submitted such an article, and indicating that the
author had a great deal to learn before he could feel
justified in seeking a market among the best known
magazines.</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="left"><a name="IX" id="IX">IX.</a></h2>

<p>RAW MATERIAL</p>


<p>Where does the writer get his plot-germs, the raw
material which he puts through the mill of his fancy and
finally draws forth as a finished and salable product?
Life is a thing of infinite variety, and the plot-germ is a
thing of Life or it is nothing. Being a mere basic suggestion
of the story, the germs must come from the
author's experience, or from the experiences of others
which have been brought to his attention. Unconsciously
the germ lodges in his mind, and his ingenuity,
handling other phases of existence, works out the completed
plot.</p>

<p>It follows that the richer an author's experience and
the more ardent his imagination the better will be the
plot evolved, providing his fine sense of values has been
adequately cultivated. But no matter how adventurous
and varied a personal experience, or how warm the
fancy, or how highly cultivated the mind in its adaptation
of fact to fiction, the experience of others compels
attention if a writer's work is to be anything more
than self-centered.</p>

<p>Newspapers, chronicling the everyday events of human
existence, have not only suggested countless successful
plot-germs but have likewise helped in the rounding
out of the plot. An editor wrote Edwards, as long
ago as March 30, 1893: "What we require in our stories
is something written up to date, with incidents new and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
original. The daily press is teeming with this raw material."
This fact is universally recognized, so that very
few authors neglect to avail themselves of this source
of inspiration.</p>

<p>As a case in point, a few years ago one noted author
was accused of appropriating the work of another noted
author. Plagiarism was seemingly proved by evoking
the aid of the deadly parallel. Nevertheless the evidence
was far from being conclusive. Each author had done
no more than build a similar story upon the same newspaper
clipping! Neither was in the wrong. No one
writer has a monopoly of the facts of life, or of the
right to use those facts as they filter through columns
of the daily press.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Edwards, he realized the value of
newspaper clippings very early in his writing career.
Twenty-five years ago he began to scissor and to put
away those clippings which most impressed him. Until
late in the year 1893 his clipping collection was either
pasted in scrap-books or thrown loosely into a large
box. During the winter of 1893-4 he felt the necessity
of having the raw material of his Factory stored more
systematically. The services of an assistant were secured
and the work was begun.</p>

<p>Large manila envelopes were used. The envelopes
were lettered alphabetically, and each clipping was filed
by title. On the back of each envelope was typed the
title of its contents.</p>

<p>This method was found to be wholly unsatisfactory.
Frequent examination had given Edwards a fair working
knowledge of his thousands of clippings, but he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
often obliged to go through a dozen or more envelopes
before finding the particular article whose title had
escaped him.</p>

<p>In 1905 he bought a loose-leaf book and tried out a
new system on an accumulation of several thousand
magazines. This indexing was done in such a way as
to suggest the character of the clipping (written in red),
and the title of the article, the page number and number
of the magazine (written in black). All the magazines
had been numbered consecutively and placed on convenient
shelves. The first page of "W," for instance, appeared
as shown below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Washington</i> "A Job in the Senate" 771-3<br />
<i>Wild Animal Story</i> "The Rebellion of a Millionaire" 477-4<br />
<i>Washington, Booker T.</i> "Riddle of the Negro" 519-4<br />
<i>White Cross</i> "Work of the American W. C." 129-5<br />
<i>Waitress</i> "Diary of an Amateur W." 543-6<br />
<i>Wall Street</i> "The Shadow of High Finance" 336-8<br />
<i>Woman Suffrage</i> "Worlds Half-Citizens" 411-8<br />
<i>Woman</i> "How to Make Money" 495-9<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is only part of one of many pages of W's,
and will serve to exemplify the advantages and disadvantages
of the system in practical use. For instance,
if it was desired to find out something about Booker T.
Washington, all that was necessary was to take down
old magazine No. 4 and turn to page 519.</p>

<p>This manifestly was an improvement over the old
envelope method of indexing, but still left much to be
desired. To illustrate, if Edwards wished to exhaust
his material on Booker T. Washington it was necessary
for him to hunt through all the pages under "W," and
then examine all the magazines containing the articles in
which he was mentioned. It is patent that if the indexing
were properly done, every reference having to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
with Booker T. Washington should follow a single reference
to him in the index; and, further, the various
articles should be grouped together.</p>

<p>Two years later, Edwards discarded the loose-leaf
for the card system. This, he found, was as near perfection
as could be hoped for.</p>

<p>His first step was to buy a number of strong box
letter-files. These he numbered consecutively, just as
he had numbered the manila envelopes. Articles are cut
from magazines, the leaves secured together with brass
fasteners, and on the first page margin at the top are
marked the file number and letter of compartment
where the article belongs. Thus, if the article is kept
out of the file for any length of time it can be readily
returned to its proper place. Newspaper clippings are
handled in precisely the same way.</p>

<p>The card index has its divisions and sub-divisions.
Cards indexing articles on various countries have a
place under the general letter, and another place in the
geographical section under the same letter. So with
articles concerning Noted Personages, Astronomy, Antiquities,
etc. Below, for the benefit of any one who
may wish to use the system, is reproduced a card from
the file:</p>


<p class="center">ARMY, U. S.</p>

<table summary="ARMY, U. S.">
<tr><td>Hand Bill used to secure enlistments </td><td>"A"</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Army Story "Knew It"</td><td>"K"</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Army Story "A Philippine Romance"</td><td>"P"</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Army Story "He is Crazy Jack"</td><td>"C"</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Army Story "Their Very Costly Meal"</td><td>"T"</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Army Story "Siege of Bigbag"</td><td>"S"</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Fighting Life in the Philippines"</td><td>"F"</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pay of Soldiers "Young Man&mdash;"</td><td>"Y"</td><td>2</td></tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>In this system the character of the material is first
indicated, as <i>Pay of Soldiers</i>. If there is a title it follows
in quotation marks. Where the title suggests the
character of the material sufficiently, the title comes
first, in "quotes." Then follows the letter under which
the article is filed, and the number of the file. Suppose
it is desired to find out what soldiers of the United
States' Army are paid for their services: File No. 2
is removed from the shelf, opened at letter "Y" and the
information secured under title beginning, "Young
Man&mdash;."</p>

<p>As a saver of time, and a guard against annoyance
when fancies are running free, Edwards has found his
card-index system for clippings almost ideal.</p>

<blockquote class="bbox">

<p>A friend of Edwards' is what the comic papers call
a "jokesmith." Recently he concocted the following:</p>

<p>"You must be doing well," said Jones the merchant
to Quill the writer, meeting him in front of his house.
"You seem to be always busy, and you look prosperous."</p>

<p>"So I am, Jones," answered Quill, "busy and prosperous.
Come into the basement with me and I'll show you
the secret of my prosperity."</p>

<p>They descended into the basement and Quill rang up
the curtain on a ragman weighing three big bags of rejection
slips.</p>

<p>"My stories all come back," confessed Quill, triumphantly,
"and I get three cents a pound for the rejection
slips that come with them."</p>

<p>This, of course, was not much of a joke, but the perpetrator
sent it to <i>Judge</i>. <i>Judge</i> sent it back with about
twenty blank rejection slips inclosed by a rubber band.
On the top slip was written: "Here are some more.&mdash;Ed.
<i>Judge</i>."</p></blockquote>

THE WOLF<br />
AT THE DOOR<br />
</p>


<p>Perhaps very few men in this life escape a period as
black and dispiriting as was the year 1897 for Edwards.
If not in one way, then in another, it is the fate of a
man to be chastened and subdued so thoroughly, at least
once in his career, that a livid remembrance of it remains
always with him. Edwards has always been an
optimist, but those blows of circumstance of the year
1897 found many weak places in the armor of his philosophy.</p>

<p>In tangling and untangling the threads of a story
plot Edwards had become tolerably proficient, but in
straightening out the snarls Fate had made in his own
life he was crushed with a feeling of abject helplessness.
There is a vast difference, it seems, in dealing
with the complications of others and those that beset ourselves.
The impersonal attitude makes for keener analysis
and wiser judgment.</p>

<p>In a story, the poverty stricken hero and his wife
may exist for a week on a loaf of bread, ten cents' worth
of potatoes and a twenty-cent soup-bone; but let the man
who creates such a hero attempt to emulate his fictional
fancies and stark realism plays havoc with the equation.
The wolf at our own door is one sort of animal, and
the wolf at our neighbor's is of an altogether different
breed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>The thermometer in Southern Arizona was "eighty
in the shade" when Mr. and Mrs. Edwards, during the
Christmas holidays, set their faces eastward. New York
City, the shrine of so many pilgrims seeking prosperity,
was their goal; and the metropolis, on that bleak New
Year's Day that witnessed their arrival, was shivering
in the grip of real, old-fashioned winter. The change
from a balmy climate to blizzards and ice and a below-zero
temperature brought Edwards to his bed with a
vicious attack of rheumatism. For days while the little
fund of $100 melted steadily away, he lay helpless.</p>

<p>The great city, in its dealings with impecunious
strangers, has been painted in cruel colors. Edwards
found this to be a mistake. On the occasion of their
first visit to New York he and his wife had found quarters
in a boarding house in Forty-fourth street. A
pleasant landlady was in charge and the Edwards had
won her friendship.</p>

<p>Here, forming one happy family, were actors and
actresses, a salesman in a down-town department store,
a stenographer, a travelling man for a bicycle house,
and others. All were cheerful and kindly, and took
occasion to drop in at the Edwards' third floor front
and beguile the tedious hours for the invalid.</p>

<p>Fourteen years have brought many changes to Forty-fourth
street between Broadway and Sixth avenue. The
row of high-stoop brownstone "fronts" has that air of
neglect which precedes demolition and the giving way
of the old order to the new. The basement, where the
pleasant landlady sat at her long table and smiled at the
raillery and wit of "Beaney," and Sam, and "Smithy,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and Ruth, and Ina and the rest, has fallen sadly from
its high estate. A laundry has taken possession of the
place. And "Beaney," the light-hearted one who laughed
at his own misfortunes and sympathized with the misfortunes
of others, "Beaney" has gone to his long account.
A veil as impenetrable has fallen over the pleasant
landlady, Sam, "Smithy," Ruth and Ina; and where-ever
they may be, Edwards, remembering their kindness
to him in his darkest days, murmurs for each and
all of them a fervent "God bless you!"....</p>

<p>Before he was compelled to take to his bed Edwards
had called at the offices of Harte &amp; Perkins. His interview
with Mr. Perkins impressed upon him the fact that,
once a place upon the contributors' staff of a big publishing
house is relinquished it is difficult to regain.
Others had been given the work which Edwards had had
for three years. These others were turning in acceptable
manuscripts and, in justice to them, Harte &amp; Perkins
could not take the work out of their hands. Mr.
Perkins, however, did give Edwards an order for four
Five-Cent Libraries&mdash;stories to be held in reserve in
case manuscripts from regular contributors failed to arrive
in time. On Feb. 11 he received a letter from the
firm to the following effect:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When we wrote you day before yesterday asking you to
turn in four Five-Cent Libraries before doing anything else in
the Library line for us, we were under the impression that the
gentleman who has been engaged upon this work for some time
would not be able to turn the material in with usual regularity
on account of illness, but we hear from him today that he is
now in better health, and will be able to keep up with the work,
which he is very anxious to do, and somewhat jealous of having
any other material in the series so long as he can fill the bill.
On this account it will be well for you to stop work on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Library. When you have completed the story on which you are
now engaged, turn your attention to the Ten-Cent Library
work, which we think you will be able to do to our satisfaction."</p></blockquote>

<p>This will illustrate the attitude which some authors
assume toward the "butter-in." All of a certain grist
that comes to a publisher's mill must be <i>their</i> grist. If
the mill ground for another, and found the product better
than ordinary, the other might secure a "stand-in"
that would threaten the prestige of the regular contributor.</p>

<p>In seeking to keep his head above water financially,
Edwards attempted to sell book rights of "The Astrologer,"
the serial published in 1891 in <i>The Detroit Free
Press</i>. He had written, also, 66 pages of a present-tense
Gunteresque story which he hoped would win
favor as had his other stories in that style. This yarn
he called "Croesus, Jr." Both manuscripts were submitted
to Harte &amp; Perkins.</p>

<p>On Jan. 28, when the Edwards' exchequer was nearly
depleted, "Croesus, Jr.," was returned with this written
message:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It might be said of the story in a way that it is readable,
but it does not promise as good a story as we desire for this
series. 'Most decidedly,' says the reader, 'it lacks originality,
novelty and strength.' This criticism, which we consider entirely
competent, must deter us from considering the story
favorably."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was blow number one. Blow number two was
delivered Feb. 3:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have had your manuscript, 'The Astrologer,' examined,
and the verdict is that it would not be suitable for any of our
regular publications, and it is not in our line for book publication.
The reader states that it very humorous in parts but
rather long drawn out.... We return manuscript."</p></blockquote>

<p>Two Five-Cent Libraries at $40 each were accepted
and paid for; also four sketches written for a small
magazine which Harte &amp; Perkins were starting.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>Although he grew better of his rheumatism, Edwards
failed to improve materially in health, and late in March
he and his wife returned to Chicago. They rented a
modest flat on the North Side, got their household effects
out of storage, and faced the problem of existence
with a courage scarcely warranted by their circumstances.</p>

<p>Edwards was able to work only half a day. The remainder
of the day he spent in bed with an alternation
of chills and fever and a grevious malady growing upon
him. During this period he tried syndicating articles in
the newspapers but without success. He also wrote for
Harte &amp; Perkins a "<i>Guest</i>" serial, the order for which
he had brought back with him from New York. He
made one try for this by submitting the first few chapters
and synopsis of story which he called "A Vassar
Girl." These were returned to him as unsuitable. He
then wrote seven chapters of a serial entitled, "A Girl
from the Backwoods," and&mdash;with much fear and trembling
be it confessed&mdash;sent them on for examination.
Under date of July 8 this word was returned:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The seven chapters of 'A Girl from the Backwoods' read
very good, and we should like to have you finish the story, and
should it prove satisfactory in its entirety, we should consider it
an acceptable story."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here was encouragement at a time when encouragement
was sorely needed. But how to keep the Factory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
going while the story was being finished was a difficult
question. There were times when twenty-five cents had
to procure a Sunday dinner for two; and there was a
time when two country cousins arrived for a visit, and
Edwards had not the half-dollar to pay an expressman
for bringing their trunks from the station! Pride, be it
understood, was one of Edwards' chief assets. He had
always been a regal spender, and his country cousins
knew it. How the lack of that fifty-cent piece grilled his
sensitive soul!</p>

<p>It was during these trying times that the genius of
Mrs. Edwards showed like a star in the heavy gloom.
On next to nothing she contrived to supply the table,
and the conjuring she could do with a silver dollar was
a source of never-failing wonder to her husband.</p>

<p>Edwards remembers that, at a time when there was
not even car-fare in the family treasury, a check for
$1.50 arrived in payment for a 1,500-word story that had
been out for several years.</p>

<p>During the latter part of July the demand for money
pending the completion of "A Girl from the Backwoods"
became so insistent, that Edwards wrote and submitted
to Harte &amp; Perkins a sketch for their magazine. It contained
1,232 words and was purchased on Aug. 3 for
$6.16.</p>

<p>"A Girl from the Backwoods" was submitted late in
September, and was returned on Oct. 13 for a small
correction. The following letter, dated Oct. 27, was received
from the editor of the "Guest:"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The manuscript of 'A Girl from the Backwoods', also the
correction which you have made, have been duly received. The
correction is very satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to your suggestion about the heroine's name being
that of a well known writer, we would say that inasmuch as
the name is rather appropriate and suits the character we do not
see that the lady who already bears it would in any way find
fault with your use of it, and at present we think it may be
allowed to stand."</p></blockquote>

<p>As showing Edwards' pecuniary distress, the following
paragraph from a letter from Harte &amp; Perkins, dated
Oct. 28, may be given:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In response to your favor of the 19th and your telegram
of yesterday,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> we enclose you herewith our check for
$200 in full for your story 'A Girl from the Backwoods.'
This is the best price we can make you for this and other stories
of this class from your pen, and it is a somewhat better one than
we are now paying for similar material from other writers.
We believe this will be satisfactory to you."</p></blockquote>

<p>The price was not satisfactory. Edwards and his
wife had counted upon receiving at least $300 for the
story, and they needed that amount sorely. A respectful
letter at once went forward to Harte &amp; Perkins, appealing
to their sense of justice and fairness, which Edwards
had never yet known to fail him. On Nov. 3
came an additional check for $100, and these words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Replying to your favor of Nov. 1st, at hand today, we beg
to state that we shall, agreeably with your request and especially
as you put it in such strong terms, make the payment on 'A Girl
from the Backwoods' $300. The story is much liked by our
reader and we do think it is worth as much if not more than
the Stella Edwards material which, however, in the writer's
judgement was much overpaid. We shall take this into account
when considering the acceptance of other stories from your
pen, and while we do not say positively that we will not pay
$300 for the next one, as we wrote you in our last letter this is
a high price for this class of material and we will expect to pay
you according to our views as to the value of the manuscript."</p></blockquote>

<p>The year closed with an order from Harte &amp; Perkins
for another story of the Stella Edwards sort; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
very dismal year indeed, and showing Factory returns as
follows:</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, this was not doing so badly; for
during this year, and the year immediately following,
Edwards was to discover that he had had one foot in the
grave. But his fortunes were at their lowest ebb. With
1898 they were to begin taking an upward turn.</p>

the dug-out in which I lived, and filled in the gaps with
other matter drawn from his imagination, making me
out a sort of literary troglodyte; whereas, as a matter
of fact, I had never lived in a dug-out. On top of it, one

<p>
WHEN FICTION IS<br />
STRANGER THAN TRUTH.<br />
</p>


<p>We are told that "fiction hath in it a higher end than
fact," which we may readily believe; and we may also
concede that "truth is stranger than fiction," at least in
its occasional application. Nevertheless, in the course of
his career as a writer Edwards has created two fictional
fancies which so closely approximated truth as to make
fiction stranger than truth; and, in one case, the net result
of imagination was to coincide exactly with real facts
of which the imagination could take no account. Perhaps
each of these two instances is unique in its particular
field; they are, in any event, so odd as to be worthy
of note.</p>

<p>In the early 90's, when a great deal of Edwards'
work was appearing, unsigned, in <i>The Detroit Free
Press</i>, he wrote for that paper a brief sketch entitled,
"The Fatal Hand." The sketch was substantially as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Northern Pacific Railroad had just been built into
Helena, Montana, and I happened to be in the town one
evening and stepped into a gambling hall. Burton, a friend of
mine, was playing poker with a miner and two professional
gamblers. I stopped beside the table and watched the game.</p>

<p>Cards had just been drawn. Burton, as soon as he had
looked at his hand, calmly shoved the cards together, laid them
face-downward in front of him, removed a notebook from his
pocket and scribbled something on a blank leaf. 'Read that,'
said he, 'when you get back to your hotel tonight.'</p>

<p>The play proceeded. Presently the miner detected one of the
professional gamblers in the act of cheating. Words were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
passed, the lie given. All the players leaped to their feet.
Burton, in attempting to keep the miner from shooting, received
the gambler's bullet and fell dead upon the scattered cards.</p>

<p>An hour later, when I reached my hotel, I thought of the
note Burton had handed me. It read: 'I have drawn two red
sevens. I now hold jacks full on red sevens. It is a fatal hand
and I shall never leave this table alive. I have $6,000 in the
First National Bank at Bismarck. Notify my mother, Mrs.
Ezra J. Burton, Louisville, Kentucky.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>This small product of the Fiction Factory was pure
fiction from beginning to end. In the original it had the
tang of point and counterpoint which caused it to be
seized upon by other papers and widely copied. This
gave extensive publicity to the "fatal hand"&mdash;the three
jacks and two red sevens contrived by Edwards out of a
small knowledge of poker and the cabala of cards.</p>

<p>Yet, what was the result?</p>

<p>A month later the Chicago papers published an account
of a police raid on a gambling room. As the officers
rushed into the place a man at one of the tables fell
forward and breathed his last. "Heart disease," was
the verdict. But note: A police officer looked at the
cards the dead man had held and found them to be <i>three
jacks and two red sevens</i>.</p>

<p>A week later <i>The New York Recorder</i> gave space to
a news story in which a man was slain at a gaming
table in Texas. When the smoke of the shooting had
blown away some one made the discovery that he had
held the fatal hand.</p>

<p>From that time on for several months the fatal hand
left a trail of superstition and gore all over the West.
How many murders and hopeless attacks of heart failure
it was responsible for Edwards had no means of knowing,
but he could scarcely pick up a paper without finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
an account of some of the ravages caused by his
"jacks full on red sevens."</p>

<p>Query: Were the reporters of the country romancing?
If not, will some psychologist kindly rise and explain
how a bit of fiction could be responsible for so
much real tragedy?</p>

<p>In this instance, fancy established a precedent for
fact; in the case that follows, the frankly fictitious paralleled
the unknown truth in terms so exact that the
story was recognized and appropriated by the son of the
story's hero.</p>

<p>While Edwards was in Arizona he was continually
on the alert for story material. The sun, sand and solitude
of the country "God forgot" produce types to be
found nowhere else. He ran out many a trail that led
from adobe-walled towns into waterless deserts and
bleak, cacti-covered hills to end finally at some mine or
cattle camp. It was on one of these excursions that he
was told how a company of men had built a dam at a
place called Walnut Grove. This dam backed up the
waters of a river and formed a huge lake. Mining for
gold by the hydraulic method was carried on profitably
in the river below the dam. One night the dam "went
out" and a number of laborers were drowned.</p>

<p>With this as the germ of the plot Edwards worked
out a story. He called it "A Study in Red," and it purported
to show how a lazy Maricopa Indian, loping
along on his pony in the gulch below Walnut Grove, gave
up his mount to a white girl, daughter of the superintendent
of the mining company, and while she raced on to
safety he remained to die in the flood from the broken
dam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>The story was published in <i>Munsey's Magazine</i>.
<i>Six years later</i> the author received a letter from the
Maricopa Indian Reservation, sent to New York in care
of the F. A. Munsey Company. The letter was from a
young Maricopa.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have often read the account of my father's bravery, and
how he saved the life of the beautiful white girl when the
Walnut Grove dam gave way. I have kept the magazine, and
whenever I feel blue, or life does not go to please me, I get the
story and read it and take heart to make the best of my lot and
try to pattern after my father.</p>

<p>I have long wanted to write you, and now I have done so.
I am back from the Indian School at Carlisle, on a visit to my
people, and am impelled to send you this letter of appreciation
and thanks for the story about my father."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, pray, what is one to think of this? The letter
bears all the earmarks of a <i>bona fide</i> performance and
was written and mailed on the Reservation. Edwards'
fiction, it seems, had become sober fact for this young
Maricopa Indian. Or did his father really die by giving
up his pony to the "beautiful young white girl?" And
was Edwards' prescience doing subliminal stunts when
he wrote the story?</p>

<p>John Peter, should this ever meet your eyes will you
please communicate further with the author of "A Study
in Red?" It has been some years now since a letter,
sent to you at the Reservation, failed of a reply. And
the letter has not been returned.</p>

<p>
FORTUNE BEGINS<br />
TO SMILE<br />
</p>


<p>Edwards' literary fortunes all but reached financial
zero in 1897; with 1898 they began to mount, although
the tendency upward was not very pronounced until the
month of April. During the first quarter of the year he
wrote and sold one Stella Edwards serial entitled "Lovers
En Masque." His poor health continued, and he was
able to work only a few hours each day, but the fact that
he could drive himself to the typewriter and lash his
wits into evolving acceptable work gave him encouragement
to keep at it. Early in April, with part of the
proceeds from the serial story for expenses, he made a
trip to New York.</p>

<p>"Prospecting trips" is the name Edwards gives to his
frequent journeys to the publishing center of the country.
He prospected for orders, prospected for better
prices, prospected for new markets. No fiction factory
can be run successfully on a haphazard system for disposing
of its product. There must be some market in
prospect, and on the wheel of this demand the output
must be shaped as the potter shapes his clay.</p>

<p>Edwards made it a rule to meet his publishers once a
year, secure their personal views as he could not secure
them through correspondence, and keep himself prominently
before them. In this way he secured commissions
which, undoubtedly, would otherwise have been placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
elsewhere. With each succeeding journey Edwards has
made to New York, his prospecting trips have profited
him more and more. This is as it should be. There is
no "marking time" for a writer in the fierce competition
for editorial favor; for one merely to "hold his
own" is equivalent to losing ground. The writer must
<i>grow</i> in his work. When he ceases to do that he will
find himself slipping steadily backward toward oblivion.</p>

<p>Edwards found that in reaching New York in early
April 1898, he had arrived at the psychological moment.
Harte &amp; Perkins, already described as keeping tense
fingers on the pulse of their reading public, had discovered
a feverish quickening of interest for which the
Klondike gold rush was responsible. The prognosis
was good for a new five-cent library; so the "Golden
Star Library" was given to the presses. Edwards, because
he was on the spot and urging his claims for recognition,
was chosen to furnish the copy. During the year
he wrote sixteen of these stories.</p>

<p>For half of April and all of May and June, Edwards
and his wife were at their old boarding place in Forty-fourth
street. During this time, along with the writing
of the Golden Star stories, a juvenile serial and a Stella
Edwards serial were prepared. The title of the Stella
Edwards rhapsody was "A Blighted Heart."</p>

<p>On July 2, owing to the excessive heat in the city and
a belief on Edwards' part that the country would benefit
him, the Fiction Factory was temporarily removed to
the Catskill Mountains. Comfortable quarters were secured
in a hotel near Cairo, and the work of producing
copy went faithfully on. Edwards' health improved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
somewhat, although he was still unable to keep at his
machine for a union day of eight hours.</p>

<p>Under date of Aug. 1, Harte &amp; Perkins wrote Edwards
that on account of the poor success of the Golden
Star Library they would have to stop its weekly publication
and issue it as a monthly. Mr. Perkins write:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not think that the quality of the manuscript is so
much at fault as the character of the library itself, though it is
very difficult always to know just what the boys want."</p></blockquote>

<p>Edwards was depending upon this library to support
himself and wife, and the weekly check was a <i>sine
qua non</i>. Summer-resorting is expensive, and he had
not yet had his fill of the historic old Catskills. He
wrote the firm and requested them to send on a check
for "A Blighted Heart." The blight did not confine itself
to the story but was visited upon Edwards' hopes, as
well. Harte &amp; Perkins did not respond favorably. The
serial was not to begin in "<i>The Weekly Guest</i>" until the
latter part of September, and upon beginning publication
was to be paid for in weekly installments of $25. Wrote
Mr. Perkins:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is a season when, with depressed business and the
many accounts we have to look after, it is difficult for us to
make advanced payments on manuscripts. You may rest assured
that, if conditions were otherwise, I should have been glad to
meet your wishes."</p></blockquote>

<p>This meant an immediate farewell to the stamping
grounds of good old Rip Van Winkle. Forthwith the
Edwards struck their tent and boarded a night boat at
Catskill Landing for down river. In their stateroom
that night, with a fountain pen and using the wash-stand
for a table, Edwards completed No. 16 of the ill-fated
Golden Star Library. He had begun this manuscript
before the notification to stop work on the series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
had reached him. In such cases, Harte &amp; Perkins never
refused to accept the complete story.</p>

<p>December found Edwards again settled on the North
Side, in Chicago. He had consulted a physician regarding
his health, and after a thorough examination had
been told that it would require at least a year, and perhaps
a year and a half, to cure him. The physician was
a young man of splendid ability, and as he had just "put
out his shingle" and patients were slow in rallying
"round the standard," he threw himself heart and soul
into the task of making a whole man out of Edwards.
The writer helped by leasing a flat within half a block
of his medical adviser and faced the twelve or eighteen
months to come with more or less equanimity.</p>

<p>Edwards, of course, could not recline at his ease
while the work of rehabilitation was going forward.
The family must be supported and the doctor paid.
Forty dollars a month from the Golden Star Library
would not do this. It was necessary to run up the returns
somehow and another Stella Edwards story was
undertaken. The title of this story was "Won by
Love," and Harte &amp; Perkins acknowledged receipt of
the first two installments on Dec. 6. Inasmuch as "Won
by Love" came very near being the death of its author,
it may be interesting to consider the story a little further.
The letter of the 6th ran:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have received the first two installments of 'Won by
Love' and like them very much indeed, but before giving you
a definite answer we would like to have four more instalments
on approval, making six in all. Kindly send these at your earliest
convenience and oblige."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>The four installments were sent and nothing more
was heard from them until a telegram, dated Jan. 19,
1899, was received:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Please send more of 'Won by Love' as soon as possible.
Must have it Monday."</p></blockquote>

<p>Owing to the fact that the writer of the old Five-Cent
Library, for which Edwards had furnished copy
some years before, had been taken seriously ill, this
work had been turned over to Edwards on Dec. 27, 1898.</p>

<p>At this time Edwards was confined to his bed, and
there he worked, his typewriter in front of him on an
improvised table. He had just finished several hours'
work on a library story when the telegram regarding
"Won by Love" was received. This was Saturday.
Edwards wired at once that he would send two more installments
on the following Monday. These 12,000
words went forward according to schedule, and on the
night they were sent the doctor called and found his
patient in a state of collapse. Cause, too much "Won
by Love." The young physician took it more to heart
than Edwards did.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," said he gloomily, "that you have ended
your writing for all time."</p>

<p>"You're wrong, doctor," declared Edwards; "I'm
not going to be removed until I've done something better
than pot-boilers."</p>

<p>"I want to call a specialist into consultation," was
the reply.</p>

<p>The specialist was called and Edwards was stripped
and his body marked off into sections&mdash;mapped out
with one medical eye on the "undiscovered country" and
the other on this lowly but altogether lovely "vale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
tears." When the examination was finished, the preponderance
of testimony was all in favor of the Promised
Land.</p>

<p>"I should say, Mr. Edwards," said the specialist, in
a tone professionally sympathetic, "that you have one
chance in three to get well. Your other chance is for
possibly seven or eight years of life. The third chance
allows you barely time to settle your affairs."</p>

<p>Settle his affairs! What affairs had Edwards to
settle? There was the next library to be written and
"Won by Love" to finish, but these would have netted
Mrs. Edwards no more than $340. And the smallest
chance would not suffer Edwards to leave his wife even
this pittance. Since his disastrous Arizona experience
Edwards had not been able to save any money. He was
only just beginning to look ahead to a little garnering
when the doctors pronounced their verdict. He had not
a dollar of property, real or personal, if his library was
not taken into account, and not a cent of life insurance.
After turning this deplorable situation over in his mind,
he decided that it was impossible for him to die.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take the first chance," said he, "and
make the most of it."</p>

<p>He did. The young physician gave up more of his
time and worked like a galley slave to see his patient
through. Now, thirteen years after the specialist spoke
the last word, Edwards is in robust health&mdash;the monument
of his own determination and the young doctor's
skill. Nothing succeeds&mdash;sometimes&mdash;like the logic of
<i>nil desperandum</i>.</p>

<p>To regain a foothold with his publishers, following
the disastrous year of 1897, had cost Edwards so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
persistent work that he would not cancel a single order.
He hired a stenographer and for two weeks dictated his
stories, then again resumed the writing of them himself,
in bed and with the use of the improvised table.
Success awaited all his fiction, even when turned out in
such adverse circumstances. This, perhaps, was the best
tonic he could have. He improved slowly but surely and
was able, in addition to his regular work, to write a hundred-thousand
word novel embracing his Arizona experiences.
This novel he called "He Was a Stranger."</p>

<p>The title was awkward, but it had been clipped from
the quotation, "he was a stranger, and they took him in."
The story was submitted to Harte &amp; Perkins, but they
were not in the mood for taking in strangers of that sort.
But the year following the novel secured the friendly
consideration of Mr. Matthew White, Jr., and introduced
Edwards into the Munsey publications.</p>

<p>Another novel, "The Man from Dakota," was returned
by Harte &amp; Perkins after they had had it on hand
for a year. It was declined in the face of a favorable report
by one of their readers because, "We have so many
books on hand that must be brought out during the next
year that we cannot consider this story."</p>

<p>The year 1899 closed with Fortune's smile brightening
delightfully for Edwards, and the new century
beckoning him pleasantly onward with the hope of better

<p>Edwards lives in the outskirts of a small town, on a
road much travelled by farmers. Two honest tillers of
the soil were passing his home, one day, and one of
them was heard to remark to the other: "A man by the
name of Edwards lives there, Jake. He's one of those
fictitious writers."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Edwards has few friends whom he prizes more highly
than he does Col. W. F. Cody, "Buffalo Bill," and Major
Gordon W. Lillie, "Pawnee Bill." While the Wild West
and Far East Show, of which Cody and Lillie are the
proprietors was making its farewell tour with the Last
of the Scouts, Major Lillie had this to tell about Colonel
Cody:</p>

<p>"You'd be surprised at the number of people who try
to beat their way into the show by stringing the Colonel.
The favorite way is by claiming acquaintance with
him. A stranger will approach Buffalo Bill with a
bland smile and an outstretched hand. 'Hello, Colonel!'
he'll say, 'guess who I am! I'll bet you can't guess who
I am!' Cody will give it up. 'Why,' bubbles the stranger,
'don't you remember when you were in Ogden, Utah,
in nineteen-two? Remember the crowd at the depot to
see you get off the train? Why, I was the man in the
white hat!'"</p>

<p>"Just this afternoon," laughed the Major, "Cody came
up to where I was standing. He was wiping the sweat
from his forehead and his face was red and full of
disgust. 'What's the matter?' I inquired. 'Oh,' he answered,
'another one of those d&mdash; guessing contests!
Why in blazes can't people think up something new?'"</p></blockquote>

OUR FRIEND,<br />
THE T. W.<br />
</p>


<p>In some localities of this progressive country the pen
may still be mightier than the sword; but if, afar from
railroad and telegraph, holed away in barbaric seclusion,
there really exists a community that writes with a quill
and uses elderberry ink and a sandbox, it is safe to say
that this community has never been heard of&mdash;and the
cause is not far to seek. Just possibly, however, it is
from such a backwoods township that the busy editor
receives those rare manuscripts whose chirography covers
both sides of the sheet. In this case the pen is
really mightier than the sword as an instrument for cutting
the ground out from under the feet of aspiring genius.
Just possibly, too, it was from such a place that a
typewritten letter was returned to the sender with the
indignant scrawl: "You needn't bother to print my letters&mdash;I
can read writin'."</p>

<p>Nowadays penwork is confined largely to signing
letters and other documents and indorsing checks; to
use it for anything else should be named a misdemeanor
in the statutes with a sliding scale of punishments to fit
the gravity of the offense.</p>

<p>It is not to be inferred, of course, that a man will dictate
his love letters to a stenographer. Here, indeed,
"two's company and three's a crowd." Every man
should master the T. W., and when he confides his tender
sentiments to paper for the eyes of the One Girl, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
own fingers should manipulate the keys and the T. W.,
should be equipped with a tri-chrome ribbon&mdash;red and
black record and purple copying. Black will answer for
the more subdued expressions, red should be switched on
for the warmer terms of endearment, and purple should
be used for whatever might be construed as evidence in
a court of law. Even <i>billets-doux</i> have been known to
develop a commercial value.</p>

<p>When a serviceable typewriter may be bought for $25
what excuse has anyone for side-stepping the inventive
ingenuity of the day which makes for clearness and
speed? How much does Progress owe the typewriter?
Who can measure the debt? How much does civilization
owe the telephone, the night-letter, the fast mail
and two-cent postage? Even more than to these does
Progress owe to that mechanism of springs, keys and
type-bars which makes plain and rapid the written
thought.</p>

<p>In the Edwards Fiction Factory the T. W., comprises
the entire "plant." The "hands" employed for the skilled
labor are his own, and fairly proficient. His own,
too, is the administrative ability, modest enough in all
truth yet able to guide the Factory's destiny with a fair
meed of success.</p>

<p>Since the T. W., is so important, Edwards believes in
always keeping abreast of improvements. The best is
none too good. A typed script, no less than a stereotyped
idea, is damned by mediocrity. If a typewriter
appears this year which is a distinct advance over last
year's machine, Edwards has it. Keeping up-to-date is
usually a little expensive, but it pays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early days of his writing Edwards used the old
Caligraph. It was a small machine and confined itself
to capital letters. Whenever he wished to indicate
the proper place for a capital he did it thus: HIS
NAME WAS CAESAR, AND HE LIVED IN ROME.
If he lost a letter&mdash;and letters in those days were not
easily replaced&mdash;he allowed the unknown quantity "X"
to piece out: HIX NAME WAX CAEXAR&mdash;. In
due time he came to realize the importance of neatness
and traded his first Caligraph for a later model equipped
with letters from both "cases." During twenty-two
years he has purchased at least twenty-five typewriters,
each the last word in typewriter construction at
the time it was bought. At present he has two machines,
one a "shift-key" and the other with every letter and
character separately represented on the key-board.</p>

<p>There are many makes of typewriters, and operators
are of many minds regarding the "best" makes. Edwards
has favored the full key-board as being less of a
drain upon the attention than the "shift-key" machine.
For the writer who composes upon his machine the operating
must become a habit, otherwise an elusive idea
may take wings for good while the one who evolved it is
searching out the letters necessary to nail it hard and
fast to the white sheet. Edwards has recently discovered
that he can change from his full key-board to a shift-key
and back again without materially interrupting his flow
of ideas.</p>

<p>The characters of the key-board used for ordinary
business purposes and those in demand by the writer are
somewhat different. Not always, on the key-board designed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
for commercial use, will the exclamation point be
found. This, if wanted, must be built up out of a period
and a half-ditto mark,&mdash;"." plus "'" equals "!" Such
makeshifts should be tabooed by the careful writer.
Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well, and
<i>once</i>. Three motions, two at the key-board and one at
the back-spacer, are two too many. By all means have
the real thing in exclamation points&mdash;!</p>

<p>Another makeshift with which Edwards has little
patience is the custom of using ditto marks for quotation
marks, and semi-dittos for semi-quotes. These, and
other characters, may be added to most machines by
eliminating the fractions, the oblique mark or the per
cent. sign.</p>

<p>It seems poor policy, also, to use a hyphen, or two
hyphens, to indicate a dash. Why not have the underscore
raised to the position of a hyphen and so have a
dash that <i>is</i> a dash?</p>

<p>The asterisk, "*," is a character valuable for indicating
footnotes, and the caret is often useful in
making typewritten interlineations. All these characters
Edwards has on his full key-board machine. On
the shift-key machine he must still struggle with the
built-up exclamation point, the ditto quotes and the
hyphen dash. No wonder he prefers a Smith Premier!</p>

<p>Even the best and most up-to-date typewriter cannot
answer all the demands made upon it by writers, however.
Some day the growing army of authors will receive
due attention in this matter, and the manuscript
submitted to editors will compare favorably with the
printed story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>In "Habits that Help," a very instructive article by
Walter D. Scott, professor of psychology at Northwestern
University, published in <i>Everybody's Magazine</i> for
September, 1911, appears this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some time ago I could pick out the letters on a typewriter at
a rate of about one per second. Writing is now becoming
reduced to a habit, and I can write perhaps three letters a second.
When the act has been reduced to the pure habit form, I shall be
writing at the rate of not less than five letters per second."</p></blockquote>

<p>The "pure habit form" is one for those who compose
on the typewriter to acquire. It not only means ease of
composition, but speed in the performance and perfect
legibility.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, Edwards always carried his
typewriter with him on his travels. The machine was
large and heavy and had to be handled with care, so its
transportation was no easy matter. In course of time,
and pending the invention of a practical typewriter to fit
the pocket, he became content to leave his machine at
home and rent one wherever he happened to be.</p>

<p>During one of his eastern "prospecting" trips, Edwards
and his wife left New York for a few summer
weeks in the Berkshire Hills. The T. W., remained
temporarily in the city to be overhauled and forwarded.
For a fortnight Edwards slaved with a pen, <i>writing four
manuscripts of 25,000 words each</i>. He appreciated then,
as he had never done before, the value of the typewriter
in his work. Late in the first week he began writing
and telegraphing for his machine to be sent on.</p>

<p>About the hotel it was known that Edwards expected
a typewriter by every stage from Great Barrington. He
had fretted about the non-arrival of the typewriter, and
in some manner had let fall the information that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
typewriter weighed sixty pounds. Speculation was rife
as to whether the T. W., had blue eyes or gray, and as to
what manner of dwarf or living skeleton could fulfill
the requirements at sixty pounds. When the machine
finally arrived and the square packing case was unloaded,
a host of curious ladies received the surprise of their
lives.</p>

<p>"Typewriter," commonly used as a generic name for
the machine that prints, as well as for the person who
operates it, should have its double meaning curtailed.
The young lady of pleasing face and amiable deportment,
whose deft fingers hover over the keys of a senseless
machine, is entitled to something more appropriate
in the way of a professional title.</p>

<p>Let it be "typist," after the English fashion; and instead
of saying "the typist typewrote the letter," why not
say she "typed" it?</p>

<blockquote class="bbox">

<p>An editor once returned a manuscript with a note like
this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Dear Sir:&mdash;Put it into narrative form.<br />
Yours truly, "The Editor."<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did so. A week later came this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dear Sir:&mdash;A little mystery would help. We like your
style very much. Yours truly, "The Editor."</p></blockquote>

<p>I put in the mystery. A week later,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dear Sir:&mdash;You send us good verse. Why not turn
the marked paragraphs into verse, with strong influence
on story? Well written. "Yours truly, etc."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was a good idea. The verse was acceptable. It was
so acceptable that the editor sent back the story and a
check for $5 in payment for the verse&mdash;which was all
he kept!</p></blockquote>

<p>So far in his writing career Harte &amp; Perkins had
been the heaviest purchasers of Edwards' fiction. They
had given him about all he could do of a certain class of
work, and he had not tried to find other markets for the
Factory's product. Pinning his hopes to one firm, even
though it was the best firm in the business, was unsatisfactory
in many respects. For various reasons, any one
of which is good and sufficient, a writer should have
more than one "string to his bow." Harte &amp; Perkins,
jealously watching the tastes of their reading public,
were compelled to make many and sudden changes in the
material they put out. This directly affected the writers
of the material, and Edwards was often left with no prospects
at all, and perhaps at just the time when he flattered
himself that his prospects were brightest.</p>

<p>In preceding chapters mention has been made of two
serial stories in which Edwards had vainly endeavored to
interest Harte &amp; Perkins. One of these was "The Man
from Dakota," and the other, "He Was A Stranger."
These, and another entitled "A Tale of Two Towns,"
written late in 1900, were ultimately to open new markets.</p>

<p>In a diary for the year 1900, Edwards has this under
date of Tuesday, Jan. 2:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Paisley called to see me this morning on a business
matter. It appears that the proprietor of <i>The Western World</i>
had ordered a serial from Opie Read and was not satisfied
with it.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> As <i>The Western World</i> goes to press in a few days
they must have another story at once. Later in the day I talked
with Mr. Underwood the (as I suppose) proprietor, and he
asked me to get 'The Man from Dakota' from Mr. Kerr, of
<i>The Chicago Ledger</i>. I did so and took the manuscript over
to Mr. Paisley. If it is acceptable they are to pay me $200
for it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Paisley was a gentleman with whom Mrs. Edwards
had become acquainted while attending Frank
Holme's School for Illustration, in Chicago. He was a
man of much ability.</p>

<p>Under Thursday, Jan. 4, the diary has a memorandum
to this effect:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Paisley came out to see me at noon. They like 'The
Man from Dakota' and will pay me $200 for it, divided into
three payments of $50, $50 and $100."</p></blockquote>

<p>So, finally, "The Man from Dakota" got into print.
While it was still appearing in <i>The Western World</i>; Mr.
Underwood conceived the idea of booming the circulation
of his paper by publishing a mystery story&mdash;one of
those stories in which the mystery is not revealed until
the last chapter, and for the solution of which prizes are
offered. He asked Edwards if he would write such a
story. Why should Edwards write one when he already
had on hand the mystery story unsuccessfully entered in
the old <i>Chicago Daily News</i> contest? He offered this
to Mr. Underwood. He read it and liked it. Mr. Paisley
read it and liked it. What was the very lowest figure
Edwards would take for it?</p>

<p>Mr. Underwood, in getting around to this point, told
how he had sent for Stanley Waterloo and asked him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
write the mystery story. "What will you pay?" inquired
Mr. Waterloo. "I'll give you $100," said Mr. Underwood.
Whereupon Mr. Waterloo arose in awful majesty
and strode from the office. He did not even linger
to say good-by.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Underwood to Edwards, with a
genial smile, "don't you do that if I offer you seventy-five
dollars for 'What Happened to the Colonel.'"</p>

<p>"Cash?" asked Edwards.</p>

<p>"On the nail."</p>

<p>"Give me the money," said Edwards; "I need it."</p>

<p>Now that the diary has been quoted with a reference
to Opie Read, perhaps another reference to the same
genial and talented gentleman may be pardoned:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Jan. 19, 1900.&mdash;"Opie Read made his 'first appearance in
vaudeville' this week, and Gertie (Mrs. Edwards) and I went
to the Chicago Opera House this afternoon to hear him. He
was very good, but I would rather read one of his stories than
hear him tell it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Later in the year Edwards "broke into" the papers
served by the McClure Syndicate with "A Tale of Two
Towns." After using this serial in metropolitan papers,
the McClure people sold it to The Kellogg Newspaper
Union to be used in the "patents" sent out to country
newspapers. The story was later brought out in cloth
by the G. W. Dillingham Co., New York.</p>

<p>The third novel, "He Was A Stranger," had already
been refused by Harte &amp; Perkins. Late in May, 1900,
Edwards again went "prospecting" to New York. Feeling
positive that Harte &amp; Perkins had missed some of the
good points in the story, he carried the manuscript with
him and once more submitted it. Again it was refused,
but Mr. Hall, editor of the "<i>Guest</i>," informed Edwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
that he had an excellent story but that it was impossible
for Harte &amp; Perkins to consider its purchase. Edwards
asked if he knew of a possible market. "Mr. Munsey,"
was the reply, "is looking for stories for <i>The Argosy</i>,
and I'd suggest that you take the story over there and
show it to Mr. White, <i>The Argosy's</i> editor." Edwards
tucked the novel under his arm and strolled up Fifth
Avenue to the offices of the Frank A. Munsey Company.
There, and for the first time, he met Mr. Matthew
White, Jr.</p>

<p>The impression of power, tremendous ability and a
big, two-handed grasp of <i>Argosy</i> affairs which the editor
made upon Edwards, at this time, has deepened with the
passing years. An author, as well as a keen dramatic
critic, Mr. White brings to bear on his editorial duties an
intuition that closely approximates genius. He has
proved his remarkable fitness for the post he occupies
by making <i>The Argosy</i>, since Mr. Munsey "divested it
of its knickerbockers," the most widely read of all the
purely fiction magazines. And withal he is one of the
most pleasant editors whom a writer will ever have the
good fortune to meet.</p>

<p>Mr. White was glad to consider "He Was A
Stranger." He thumbed over the pages, noted the
length, and asked what price Edwards would put upon
the manuscript in case it was acceptable. Edwards named
$500, and told of "The Brave and Fair" which Harte
&amp; Perkins, a few years before, had bought at that figure.
Mr. White replied that <i>The Argosy</i>, as yet, was unable to
pay such prices, but that he would read the story and, if
he liked it, make an offer. A few days later he offered
$250 for serial rights. Edwards took into consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the fact that the story would establish him in the columns
of a growing magazine and, with an eye to the future,
accepted the offer. He has never had occasion to regret
his decision.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the year Edwards had been
doing a large amount of five-cent library work for Harte
&amp; Perkins. A new weekly had been started, the writer
who furnished the copy failed to get his manuscript in on
time, and Edwards was given a story to finish and, a few
days afterward, the entire series to take care of.</p>

<p>At the time he sold the serial to Mr. White, he was
supplying weekly copy for two libraries&mdash;the old Five-Cent
Library and the new weekly, which shall here be
referred to as the Circus Series.</p>

<p>On the proceeds from the sale of "He Was A
Stranger" Edwards and his wife had a little outing at
Atlantic City. They returned to New York for a few
days, and then went on to Boston. Here, comfortably
quartered in a hotel, Edwards devoted his mornings to
work and his afternoons to seeing the "sights" with Mrs.
Edwards. They haunted Old Cambridge, they made pilgrimages
to Salem, to Plymouth and to other places, and
they enjoyed themselves as they had never done before
on an eastern trip. Later they finished out the summer
near Monterey, in the Berkshire Hills.</p>

<p>During all these travels the Fiction Factory was regularly
grinding out its grist of copy&mdash;so many pages a
day, so many stories a week. Two libraries, together
with a sketch each month for a trade paper published by
Harte &amp; Perkins, kept Edwards too busy to prepare any
manuscripts for <i>The Argosy</i>. Much of his work, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in the Berkshires, was done in longhand. On this point
Mr. Perkins wrote, July 25:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I should think you would miss your typewriter. I fear that
I shall miss it, too, when I read your manuscript, although I
find your writing easier to read than that of any of our other
writers."</p></blockquote>

<p>In August the Edwards went West, visited for a time
in Michigan and then in Wisconsin, finally returned to
the former state and, in the little country town where
Edwards was born, bought an old place and settled
down.</p>

<p>As with the Golden Star Library, misfortune finally
overtook the Circus Series. A telegram was received
telling Edwards to hold No. 47 of the Circus Series pending
instructions by letter. The letter instructed him to
close up finally the adventures of the hero and his
friends and bring their various activities to an appropriate
end. The series was continued, for a while longer,
with a brand-new hero in each story; but Edwards
was requested to write but three of the stories in the new
form.</p>

<p>The year, which opened auspiciously and proved a
banner year financially, closed with a discontinuance of
all orders from Harte &amp; Perkins. Re-prints were being
used in the old Five-Cent Library&mdash;stories that had been
issued years before and could now be republished for
another generation of boy readers. Under date of Dec.
1, 1911, Mr. Perkins wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I know of nothing, just at present, which you can do for
us, but should anything develop I shall be very glad to inform
you."</p></blockquote>

<p>This left Edwards with a sketch a month for the
trade paper, for which he was paid $10 each. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
"misfortunes never come singly" is an old saying, and
one which Edwards has found particularly true in the
writing profession. A letter of Dec. 27, informed him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have decided to dispense with the sketches in our trade
paper for the present, at least; therefore the February sketch
we have in hand will be the last we will want unless we give
you further notice."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a good many cases the tendency of a writer, when
fate deals hardly with him in the matter of a demand for
his work, is to take his rebuffs too seriously. Often he
will lock up his Factory, leaving a placard on the door:
"Closed. Proprietor gone to Halifax. Nothing in the
fiction game anyhow."</p>

<p>Edwards used to feel in this way. As he grew older
he learned to take his disappointments with more or less
equanimity, and to keep the Factory running. He
thought, now, of Mr. White and <i>The Argosy</i>. Here was
a good time to prepare an <i>Argosy</i> serial. He wrote it,
sent it, and on Feb. 15, 1901, received this terse letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"My dear Mr. Edwards:<br />
</p>

<p>We can use your story, 'The Tangle in Butte,' in <i>The
Argosy</i> at $200. Very truly yours,</p>

<p class="sig1">
Matthew White, Jr."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This was less than the price paid for "He Was A
Stranger," but the story ran only 60,000 words, while the
other serial had gone to 100,000. The acceptance went
to Mr. White by return mail.</p>

<p>On the day following there came a letter from Harte
&amp; Perkins ordering work in the old Five-Cent Library&mdash;work
that would keep Edwards busy for the rest of the
year. Ten of the old stories which Edwards had written
were to be revised and lengthened by 10,000 words.
For this work he was to be paid $30 for each story.
When the ten numbers had been revised and lengthened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
he was to go on with the stories, writing a new one each
week. Fifty dollars apiece was to be paid for the new
stories.</p>

<p>There was an order, too, for more sketches for the
trade paper, to be done in another vein.</p>

<p>On Aug. 5 the length of the Five-Cent Library stories
was cut from 30,000 words to 20,000, and the remuneration
was cut from $50 to $40. Another juvenile paper
was started and Edwards was asked to submit serials for
it. In fact, 1901 might be called a "boom" year for the
Fiction Factory, although the returns, while satisfactory,
were not of the "boom" variety.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader may remember the serial, "A Vassar
Girl," referred to in a previous chapter as having been
submitted to Harte &amp; Perkins and rejected. Edwards
had faith in this story and offered it to Mr. White. Mr.
White's judgment, however, tallied with that of Harte
&amp; Perkins. Under date of June 13 Mr. White wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am sorry that 'A Vassar Girl' has not borne out the
promise of the opening chapters. The interest in it is not sufficiently
<i>sustained</i> for serial use. The story might be divided
into several incidents, which do not grow inevitably the one
out of the other. For this reason it has, as a whole, proved
disappointing and I am returning the manuscript by express.
We should be glad, however, to have you continue to submit
work to us."</p></blockquote>

<p>With faith undiminished, Edwards forwarded the
story to McClure's Newspaper Syndicate. It was returned
without an explanation of any kind. Again he
prevailed upon Harte &amp; Perkins to consider it. It came
back from them on Sept. 13, with this message:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am sorry to say that we do not feel inclined to revise
our judgement with reference to your manuscript story, 'A
Vassar Girl.' I am inclined to think from looking over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
review of the story that it would be well for you to sell it just
as it is, and we hope you will be able to find a market for it
somewhere. It would not pay us to publish."</p></blockquote>

<p>Edwards knew that the story, wrought out of his Arizona
experiences, was true in local color and good of its
kind, and he failed to understand why it was not appreciated.
Then, on Sep. 14, came this from the S. S. McClure
Company:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"During July we had under consideration a story of yours
entitled, 'A Vassar Girl.' On July 31 we wrote you from the
Syndicate, informing you that we hoped to be able to use the
story as a serial in the very near future. The serial was taken
back for consideration in the book department by one of the
readers who wished again to examine it, and from there it was
erroneously returned to you. Now if you have not disposed of
the serial rights of 'A Vassar Girl' we should like you again
to forward the story to us, and we will submit it to some of our
papers as we had always intended to do. We will then give you
a prompt decision."</p></blockquote>

<p>The story was purchased, and Edwards' faith in it
was confirmed.</p>

<p>It was during this year of 1901 that Edwards had a
fleeting glimpse of fortune as a playwright. His story,
"The Tangle in Butte," had been read by an actor, a
leading man in a Kansas City stock company, who wanted
dramatic rights so that he might have a play taken from
it and written around him. Edwards proposed to write
the play himself. He did so, and was promptly offered
$5,000 for the play, payable in installments after production.
Following a good deal of correspondence it was
decided to put on the piece for a week's try-out in Kansas
City. Edwards waived his right to royalties for the
week, models of the scenery were made, rehearsals began&mdash;and
then the actor was suddenly stricken with a
serious illness and the deal was off. When he had recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
sufficiently to travel he went East, taking the
play with him. For several months he tried to interest
various managers in it, but without effect.</p>

<p>The year 1901 closed for Edwards with the sketches
for the trade paper no longer in demand; but, otherwise,
he faced a steadily brightening prospect for the Fiction
Factory.</p>

<p>A letter of commendation from the reader of a story
to the writer is not only a pleasant thing in itself but it
proves the reader a person of noble soul and high motives.
<i>Noblesse oblige!</i></p>

<p>The writer who loves his work is not of a sordid nature.
The check an editor sends him for his story is
the smallest part of his reward. His has been the joy
to create, to see a thought take form and amplify under
the spell of his inspiration. A joy which is scarcely less
is to know that his work has been appreciated by others.</p>

<p>A letter like the one below, for instance, not only
gives pleasure to the recipient but at the same time fires
a writer with determination never to let his work fall
short of a previous performance. This reader's good
will he <i>must</i> keep, at all hazards.</p>

<p>I read the story in this last <i>Argosy</i>, entitled 'Fate and the

that a man could act in the subconscious state you picture.
Deem my surprise, last night, when I read of a similar

<p>There is one sentence in this letter which Edwards
has put in capitals. If possible, he would have written
it in letters of gold. In this little world, so crowded
with sorrow and tragedy, what is it worth to have had a
share in making life pleasant for a stranger? To Edwards
it has been worth infinitely more than he received
for "Fate and the Figure Seven."</p>

<p>Another letter carries an equally pleasant message:</p>

Dear Sir:<br />
</p>

<p>Having read your former stories in <i>The Argosy</i> on
Arizona, and last night having commenced 'The Grains of
Gold,' I trust you will pardon my expression of appreciation
of said stories. I lived ten years in Arizona as private secretary
to several of the Federal Judges, and also lived in Mexico,
and am still familiar with conditions in that section.</p>

<p>I have enjoyed most keenly your handling of thrilling
scenes on Arizona soil. It is an exasperation that they appear
in serial form, as I dislike the month's interval.</p>

<p>My only purpose in writing is to express my admiration of
your plots and local color, and I remain,</p>

<p class="sig2">
Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="sig1">Richard S. S&mdash;&mdash;."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Edwards has always prided himself on keeping true
to the actual conditions of the country which forms the
screen against which his plot and characters are thrown.
This is a gratifying tribute, therefore, from one who
knows.</p>

<p>A letter which rather startled Edwards, suggesting
as it did the Maricopa Indian incident which trailed upon
the heels of "A Study in Red," is this:</p>

to know if it is ALL true. Did Sager have a daughter? And
where did Sager go when he left Arizona? Or is that just a
part of the story? I am very much interested in that character,
Sager. Can you tell me if he is still living, and where?

<p>Edwards answered this letter&mdash;he answers promptly
all such letters that come to him and esteems it a privilege&mdash;and
received a reply. It appeared that Mrs. S&mdash;
was the grand-daughter of a man whom "Sager" had
robbed of a large amount of money. "Country Rock at
Kish-Kish" was built on a newspaper clipping twenty
years old. This clipping Edwards forwarded to Mrs.
S&mdash; in the hope that it might help her in her quest for
"Sager." The letter was returned as uncalled for.
Should this ever fall under the eye of Mrs. S&mdash; she will
understand that Edwards did everything in his power to
be of assistance to her.</p>

<p>Carelessness in a writer is inexcusable. It is the one
thing which a reader will not forgive, for it is very apt
to spoil his pleasure in what would otherwise have been
a good story. This is a sublimated form of the "gold-brick
game," inasmuch as the reader pays his money for
a magazine only to find that he has been "buncoed" by
the table of contents. If there is a flaw in the factory's
product, rest assured that it will be discovered and react
to the disadvantage of everything else that comes from
the same mill.</p>

<p>Many readers will be found whose interest in a writer's
work is so keen that they are tempted to offer suggestions.
Such suggestions are not to be lightly considered.
Magazines are published to please their readers,
and they are successful in a direct ratio with their ability
to accomplish this end. Naturally, the old doggerel concerning
"many men of many minds" will apply here, and
a single suggestion that has not a wide appeal, or that
fails to conform to the policy of the magazine, must be
handled with great care.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that a comedian will get after
a writer with a stuffed club or a slapstick. Some anonymous
humorist, upon reading a story of Edwards' in <i>The
Argosy</i>, labored and brought forth the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="date">

<p>I cannot understand why you failed to send me the proof-sheets
of this story for correction, as you did with 'There and
Back.' It is evident so far as I have read the person who
corrected your proof-sheets was as ignorant as yourself.</p>

<p>Where you got the material for this story is not within my
memory, retrospective though it is, and I am sure you must
have been on one of your periodical drunks, otherwise the
flights of fancy you have taken would have been more rational
and not so far removed beyond the pale of the human intellect.</p>

<p>Now, my dear John, I beg of you to give up going on
these habitual tears, because you are not only ruining your
constitution but your reputation as a writer is having reflections
cast upon it. I trust you will not take this letter as a
sermon but rather in a spirit of friendly counsel.</p>

<p>I hope you will send me at once the remaining chapters of
this great 'At Large in Terra Incognita.'</p>

<p>Readers have usually the courage of their convictions
and not many anonymous letters find their way into the
office of the Fiction Factory. Edwards remembers one
other letter which was signed "Biff A. Hiram." At that
time Edwards did not know Mr. Biff A. Hiram from
Adam, but he has since made the gentleman's acquaintance,
and discovered how wide is his circle of friends.</p>

<p>If praise from a reader has a tendency to exalt, then
how much more of the flattering unction may a writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
lay to his soul when approval comes from a brother or
sister of the pen? With such a letter, this brief symposium
from the Factory files may be brought to a close.</p>

<p><b>Rules for Authors.</b></p>

<p>Dr. Edward Everett Hale, author of "The Man without
a Country," and other notable books, gives a few rules
which are of interest to the author and the journalist.
Dr. Hale's success in the literary world makes these rules,
gleaned from the field of experience, especially valuable
to young writers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Know what you want to say.</p>

<p>2. Say it.</p>

<p>3. Use your own language.</p>

<p>5. A short word is better than a long one.</p>

<p>6. The fewer words, other things being equal, the better.</p>

<p>
GROWING<br />
PROSPERITY<br />
</p>


<p>The years 1902 and 1903 were busier years than
ever for the Fiction Factory. Nineteen-two is to be
remembered particularly for opening a new departure
in the story line in <i>The Argosy</i>, and for placing the
first book with the G. W. Dillingham Company. Nineteen-three
claims distinction for seeing the book brought
out and for boosting the Factory returns beyond the
three-thousand-dollar mark. But it must not be inferred
that the book had very much to do with this. Edwards'
royalties for the year were less than $100.</p>

<p>In September, 1902, Edwards made one of his customary
"prospecting" trips to New York. If there was
anything in omens his stay in the city promised dire
things. On the second day after his arrival he went to
Coney Island with a friend. Together they called on the
seventh son of a seventh son and had their palms read.
The dispenser of occult knowledge assured Edwards that
the future was <i>very</i> bright, that Tuesday was his lucky
day and that Spring was the best time for him to consummate
his business undertakings. That day, as it happened,
was Tuesday. In the teeth of this promising
augury, and within ten minutes after leaving the palmist's
booth, some Coney Island "dip" shattered Edwards' confidence
in Tuesday by annexing his wallet. The wallet,
as it happened, contained all the money Edwards had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
brought from home, with the exception of a little loose
change.</p>

<p>This was the second time Edwards had been all but
stranded in the Metropolis, and this time the stranding
was more complete. When he cast up accounts that
evening he found himself with a cash balance of $1.63.
Fortunately Mrs. Edwards was not along. He had left
her at home with the understanding that she was to
come on later. When a writer has come within hailing
distance of the bread line there remains but one thing to
do, and that is to start the Factory going with day and
night shifts.</p>

<p>Edwards called on Mr. White, of <i>The Argosy</i>, and
outlined a serial story. He was told to go ahead with
it. For five days Edwards hardly stirred from his room.
At the end of that time he had completed "The Desperado's
Understudy," and had sold it to Mr. White for
$250, spot cash.</p>

<p>After completing this serial, Edwards outlined to Mr.
White a novelette which would furnish <i>The Argosy</i> with
something new in the fiction line. The plot was based
on a musical extravaganza which he had written, several
years before, in collaboration with Mr. Eugene Kaeuffer,
at one time connected with <i>The Bostonians</i>. Nothing
had ever come of this ambitious effort, although book
and musical score were completed and offered to Mr.
McDonald of <i>The Bostonians</i> and to Mr. Thomas Q.
Seabrooke. Mr. White liked the idea of the story immensely
and gave Edwards <i>carte blanche</i> to go ahead
with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>This story, "Ninety, North," paved the way for other
fantastic yarns which made a decided hit in <i>The Argosy</i>
and so pointed Edwards along a fresh line of endeavor
which proved as congenial as it was profitable.</p>

<p>Several months before he visited New York Edwards
had sold to The McClure Syndicate, a juvenile serial
which may be referred to here as "The Campaign at
Topeka." For this he had been offered $200, which offer
he promptly accepted. He had not received a check,
however, and was at a loss to understand the reason.
To this day the reason remains obscure, although later
events pointed to a misunderstanding of some kind regarding
the story between the Syndicate and one of its
readers. Before Edwards left New York he was paid
the $200. More than a year afterward he was informed
that the serial had been sold to the Century Company for
<i>St. Nicholas</i>, and that after publication in that magazine
it was to be brought out in book form.</p>

<p>It was Mr. T. C. McClure who put Edwards in touch
with the Dillingham Company and referred him to them
as prospective publishers, in cloth, of the successful
Syndicate story, "A Tale of Two Towns." Edwards
submitted galley proofs of the serial to Mr. Cook of the
Dillingham Company, and ultimately signed a contract
to have the book published on the usual royalty basis of
ten per cent.</p>

<p>For Harte &amp; Perkins, during the year, the Factory
ground out nickel novels, juvenile serials, one sketch for
the trade paper and a few detective stories. On Nov.
28, after he had returned home from New York, he was
notified:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Much as I regret to inform you of it, by a recent purchase
of copyright stories we are placed in a position where we will
not require any further material for any of our five-cent
libraries for some time to come, so we must discontinue
orders to you for all this material."</p></blockquote>

<p>Edwards, in a way, had become hardened to messages
of this kind. <i>The Argosy</i> was an anchor to windward,
and he resolved to give his attention to serials for Mr.
White. In December, 1902, and January and February,
1903, he wrote and forwarded "Ninety, North," a second
fantastic story called "There and Back," and the
Arizona serial "Grains of Gold." All three of these
stories were sold at once, bringing in $700. In a letter
dated Oct. 14, 1903, Mr. White had this to say about
"There and Back:"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thanks for letting me see the enclosed letter regarding
'Ninety, North.' I am equally pleased with yourself at its
significance. I am wondering whether you have heard much
about your story 'There and Back?' My impression is that
that has been one of the most popular stories you have ever
written for <i>The Argosy</i>. When I see you I will tell you an
odd little circumstance that occurred in connection with its
run in the magazine."</p></blockquote>

<p>The circumstances referred to by Mr. White took
place in Paris. One of <i>The Argosy's</i> readers happened
to be in a café, looking over proofs of a forthcoming installment
of "There and Back" while at her luncheon,
when she heard the story being discussed, in complimentary
terms, by a number of Frenchmen at an adjoining
table. Strange indeed that Frenchmen should be interested
in an American story, and stranger still that <i>The
Argosy's</i> reader should be reading an installment of the
very same story while men in that foreign café were discussing
it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The first installment of "There and Back," Mr.
White informed Edwards, had increased <i>The Argosy's</i>
circulation <i>seven thousand copies</i>.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>On March 2 Harte &amp; Perkins requested Edwards to
continue work on the old Five-Cent Library. By taking
up this work again he would be diminishing the Factory's
serial output, but he reflected that his fertility in the
matter of serials would soon have Mr. White over-supplied.
Therefore Edwards decided to go on with the
nickel weeklies.</p>

<p>In March, as Mr. MacLean of <i>The Popular Magazine</i>
once put it, Edwards "came out in cloth," the Dillingham
Company issuing "A Tale of Two Towns" on St.
Patrick's Day.</p>

<p>What are the feelings of an author when he opens
his first book for the first time? If you, dear reader,
are yet to "get out in cloth" for the first time, then some
day you will know. But, if you value your peace of
mind, do not build too gorgeous an air castle on the
foundation of this printed thing. Printed things are at
the mercy of the reviewers and, in a larger sense, of the
great reading public. The reviewers, in nearly every
instance, were kind with "A Tale of Two Towns." In
many quarters it was praised fulsomely, but the book
did not strike that fickle sentiment called popular fancy.
In six months, Mr. Cook, of the Dillingham Company,
wrote Edwards that "A Tale of Two Towns" was "a
dead duck." In the December settlement, however, the
remains yielded royalties of $96.60. For two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
years the royalties trailed along, and finally the edition
was wound up with a payment of $1.50. <i>Sic transit
gloria!</i></p>

<p>During January, 1903, a theatrical gentleman requested
Edwards to dramatize a book which Messrs.
Street &amp; Smith had issued in paper covers. "You can
change the title," the gentleman suggested, "and slightly
change the incidents. In that way it won't be necessary
to write Street &amp; Smith for permission or, indeed, to let
them know anything about it." Edwards knew, however,
that nothing will so surely wreck a writer's prospects as
playing fast and loose with editors and publishers. He
refused to consider the theatrical gentleman's proposition.
Instead, he forwarded his <i>Argosy</i> story, "The
Desperado's Understudy," upon which Mr. White had
given him dramatic rights, and offered to make a stage
version of it. The offer was accepted and a play was
built up from the story. The theatrical gentleman was
pleased and said he would give $1,500 for the dramatization.
Then, alas! the theatrical gentleman's company
went on the rocks at the Alhambra Theatre, in Chicago,
and Edwards had repeated his former playwriting experience.</p>

<p>As several gentlemen in these times, by the wonderful
force of genius only, without the least assistance of
learning, perhaps without being able to read, have made a
considerable figure in the republic of letters; the modern
critics, I am told, have lately begun to assert, that all kind
of learning is entirely useless to a writer, and indeed, no
other than a kind of fetters on the natural sprightliness
and activity of the imagination, which is thus weighed
down, and prevented from soaring to those high flights
which otherwise it would be able to reach.</p>

<p>This doctrine, I am afraid, is at present carried much
too far; for why should writing differ so much from
other arts? The nimbleness of a dancing-master is not at

<p>
ETHICS OF THE<br />
NICKEL NOVEL<br />
</p>


<p>Is the nickel novel easy to write? The writer who
has never attempted one is quite apt to think that it is.
There are hundreds of writers, the Would-be-Goods,
making less than a thousand a year, who would throw up
their hands in horror at the very thought of debasing
their art by contriving at "sensational" five-cent fiction.
So far from "debasing their art," as a matter of fact
they could not lift it to the <i>high plane</i> of the nickel novel
if they tried. Of these Would-be-Goods more anon&mdash;to
use an expression of the ante-bellum romancers. Suffice
to state, in this place, writers of recognized standing,
and even ministers, have written&mdash;and some now
are writing&mdash;these quick-moving stories. There's a
knack about it, and the knack is not easy to acquire. No
less a person than Mr. Richard Duffy, formerly editor
of <i>Ainslee's</i> and later of the <i>Cavalier</i>, a man of rare
gifts as a writer, once told Edwards that the nickel novel
was beyond his powers.</p>

<p>So far as Edwards is concerned, he gave the best
that was in him to the half-dime "dreadfuls," and he
made nothing dreadful of them after all. He has written
hundreds, and there is not a line in any one of them
which he would not gladly have his own son read. In fact,
his ethical standard, to which every story must measure
up, was expressed in this mental question as he worked:
"If I had a boy would I willingly put this before him?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
If the answer was No, the incident, the paragraph, the
sentence or the word was eliminated. In 1910 Edwards
wrote his last nickel novel, turning his back deliberately
on three thousand dollars a year (they were paying him
$60 each for them then), not because they were "debasing
his art" but because he could make more money at
other writing&mdash;for when one is forty-four he must get
on as fast as he can.</p>

<p>The libraries, as they were written by Edwards, were
typed on paper 8-1/2" by 13", the marginal stops so
placed that a typewritten line approximated the same
line when printed. Eighty of these sheets completed a
story, and five pages were regularly allowed to each
chapter. Thus there were always sixteen chapters in
every story.</p>

<p>First it is necessary to submit titles, and scenes for
illustration. Selecting an appropriate title is an art in
itself. Alliteration is all right, if used sparingly, and
novel effects that do not defy the canons of good taste
should be sought after. The title, too, should go hand
in hand with the picture that illustrates the story. This
picture, by the way, has demands of its own. In the
better class of nickel novels firearms and other deadly
weapons are tabooed. The picture must be unusual and
it must be exciting, but its suggested morality must be
high.</p>

<p>The ideas for illustrations all go to the artist days or
even weeks in advance of the stories themselves. It is
the writer's business to lay out this prospective work intelligently,
so that he may weave around it a group of
logical stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Usually the novels are written in sets of three; that
is, throughout such a series the same principal characters
are used, and three different groups of incidents are
covered. In this way, while each story is complete in
itself, it is possible to combine the series and preserve
the effect of a single story from beginning to end. These
sets are so combined, as a matter of fact, and sold for
ten cents.</p>

<p>Each chapter closes with a "curtain." In other
words, the chapter works the action up to an interesting
point, similar to a serial "leave-off," and drops a quick
curtain. Skill is important here. The publishers of this
class of fiction will not endure inconsistency for a moment.
The stories appeal to a clientele keen to detect
the improbable and to treat it with contempt.</p>

<p>Good, snappy dialogue is favored, but it must be dialogue
that moves the story along. An apt retort has no
excuse in the yarn unless it really belongs there. A multitude
of incidents&mdash;none of them hackneyed&mdash;is a prime
requisite. Complexity of plot invites censure&mdash;and usually
secures it. The plot must be simple, but it must
be striking.</p>

<p>One author failed because he had his hero-detective
strain his massive intellect through 20,000 words merely
to recover $100 that had been purloined from an old
lady's handbag. If the author had made it a million dollars
stolen from a lady like Mrs. Hetty Green, probably
his labor would have been crowned with success. These
five-cent heroes are in no sense small potatoes. They
may court perils galore and rub elbows with death, now
and then, for nothing at all, but certainly never for the
mere bagatelle of $100.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>The hero does not drink. He does not swear. Very
often he will not smoke. He is a chivalrous gentleman,
ever a friend of the weak and deserving. He accomplishes
all this with a ready good nature that has nothing
of the goody-good in its make-up. The hero does
not smoke because, being an athlete, he must keep in
constant training in order to master his many difficulties.
For the same reason he will not drink. As for
swearing, it is a useless pastime and very common; besides,
it betrays excitement, and the hero is never excited.</p>

<p>The old-style yellow-back hero was given to massacres.
He slew his enemies valiantly by brigades. Not
so the modern hero of the five-cent novel. Rarely, in
the stories, does any one cross the divide. And whenever
the villain is hurt, he is quite apt to recover, thank
the hero for hurting him&mdash;and become his sworn friend.</p>

<p>The story must be <i>clean</i>, and while it must necessarily
be exciting, it must yet leave the reader's mind with
a net profit in all the manly virtues. Is this easy?</p>

<p>Please note this extract from a letter written by
Harte &amp; Perkins Dec. 25, 1902&mdash;it covers a point whose
humor, Edwards thought, drew the sting of dishonesty:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your last story, No. 285, opened well, had plenty of
good incidents and was interesting, but there are several points
in which it might have been improved.</p>

<p>Your description of Two Spot's scheme of posing Dutchy
as a petrified boy is amusing, but the plan was dishonest and
a piece of trickery. It was all right, perhaps, to let the boys
go ahead without the knowledge of the Hero, but when he
learned of it he should have put a stop to the plan immediately.
It was all right to have him laugh at it, but at the
same time he should have spoken severely to the boys about
it and ordered them to return the money they had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
through their trick. He did not do this in your story
and it was necessary for me to alter it considerably in the
first part on that account.</p>

<p>The Hero is supposed to be the soul of honor, and in your
story he is posed as a party to a deception practised on the
citizens of Ouray, by which they were defrauded of the money
they paid for admission to see the supposed "petrified boy."
Such conduct on his part would soon lose for him the admiration
of the readers of the weekly, as it places him on a moral
level, almost, with the robbers whom he is bringing to justice."</p></blockquote>

<p>Consider that, you Would-be-Goods, who are not
above putting worse things in your "high-class" work.
And can you say "I am holier than thou" to the conscientious
writer who turns out his 20,000 or 25,000
words a week along these ethical lines? Handsome is
as handsome does!</p>

<p>Somebody is going to write these stories. There is
a demand for them. The writer who can set hand to
such fiction, who meets his moral responsibilities unflinchingly,
is doing a splendid work for Young America.</p>

<p>And yet, as stated in a previous chapter, there are
nickel novels <i>and</i> nickel novels&mdash;some to read and some
to put in the stove unread. High-minded publishers,
however, are not furnishing the careful head of the
family with material for his kitchen fire.</p>

<blockquote class="bbox">

<p>It costs you nothing to think, but it costs infinitely to
write. I therefore preach to you eternally that art of
writing which Boileau has so well known and so well
taught, that respect for the language, that connection and
sequence of ideas, that air of ease with which he conducts
his readers, that naturalness which is the true fruit of
art, and that appearance of facility which is due to toil
alone. A word out of place spoils the most beautiful
thought.&mdash;<i>Voltaire to Helvetius</i>, a young author.</p></blockquote>

<p>
KEEPING<br />
EVERLASTINGLY AT IT<br />
</p>


<p>Edwards had not visited New York in 1903, but he
landed there on Friday, Jan. 1, 1904,&mdash;literally storming
in on a train that was seven hours late on account of the
weather. A cab hurried him and his wife to the place
in Forty-fourth street where the pleasant landlady used
to hold forth, but they found, alas! that the old stamping
ground was in the hands of strangers. It was like
being turned away from home.</p>

<p>Where should they go? Edwards remembered that,
on one of his previous visits to New York, Mr. Perkins
had recommended the St. George Hotel, over in Brooklyn.
The St. George was within a few blocks of the
south end of the bridge and the offices of Harte &amp; Perkins
were in William street, close to the north end. So
Edwards and his wife went to the Brooklyn hotel and
there established their headquarters.</p>

<p>On Jan. 2 Edwards called on the patrons of his
Factory. The result was not particularly encouraging.
Harte &amp; Perkins instructed him to stop work on the
Five-Cent Library, but said that in about two months
they would have a new library for him to take care of.</p>

<p>Edwards had brought with him to the city his dramatic
version of "The Tangle in Butte," the play which
had come so near turning $5,000 into the Factory's
strong-box. It was Edwards' hope that he might be
able to dispose of the play, but the hope went glimmering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
when he learned that there were 10,000 actors
stranded in New York, and that things theatrical were
generally in a bad way.</p>

<p>During 1903 Edwards had corresponded with Mr. H.
H. Lewis, editor of <i>The Popular Magazine</i>, a recent venture
of Messrs. Street &amp; Smith's. He had submitted
manuscripts to Mr. Lewis but they had not proved to be
in line with <i>The Popular's</i> requirements. It is difficult,
through correspondence, to discover just what an editor
wants. The only way to get at such a thing properly is
by personal interview. If the would-be contributor does
not then get the editor's needs clearly in mind it is his
own fault.</p>

<p>Edwards called on Mr. Lewis and had a pleasant
chat with him. The assistant editor was Mr. A. D. Hall,
a capable gentleman who had been with Messrs. Street
&amp; Smith for many years, and with whom Edwards was
well acquainted.</p>

<p>At that time Louis Joseph Vance was writing for <i>The
Popular Magazine</i>, among others, and Edwards met him
in Mr. Lewis' office. As Edwards was leaving, after
outlining a novelette and receiving a commission to write
it, he paused with one hand on the door-knob.</p>

<p>"I'll turn in the story, Mr. Lewis," said he, "and I
hope you'll like it and buy it."</p>

<p>"Of course he'll like it and buy it," called out Vance.
"You're going to write it for him, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," returned Edwards, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're not a peddler," interrupted Vance, "to write
stuff and go hawking it about from office to office.
We're writers, and when we know what a man wants
<i>we deliver the goods</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>This was before the days of "The Brass Bowl" and
"<i>Terence O'Rourke</i>," but already Vance had found himself
and was striking the key-note of confidence. <i>Confidence</i>&mdash;that's
the word. Back it up with fair ability and
the writer will go far.</p>

<p>From <i>The Popular's</i> editorial rooms Edwards went
up Fifth avenue for a call on the editor of <i>The Argosy</i>.
Much to his disappointment Mr. White was out of town
for New Year's and would not return until the following
week.</p>

<p>The story which Edwards had presented to Mr.
Lewis in its oral and tabloid form was one that had been
written in 1903 and turned down by Mr. White. Before
offering the manuscript to <i>The Popular</i>, Edwards intended
to rewrite it and strengthen it.</p>

<p>A typewriter was ordered sent over to the St. George
Hotel, and on Jan. 3 the rewriting of the novelette was
begun. The story was called "The Highwayman's Waterloo,"
or something to that effect. On the following
day twenty-four pages of the manuscript were submitted
to Mr. Lewis, won his approval, and the rewriting
proceeded.</p>

<p>Two chapters of a serial were also offered to Mr.
White for examination. The story was called "The
Skirts of Chance," and had been begun before Edwards
left home.</p>

<p>During 1902 and '03 Edwards had worked, at odd
times, on what he designed to be a "high-class" juvenile
story. It was 60,000 words in length, when completed
in the Summer of 1903, and in September he had submitted
it to Dodd, Mead &amp; Company. Not having heard
from the story, on this January day that saw him passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
out fragments of manuscripts to <i>The Popular</i> and <i>The
Argosy</i> he went on farther up Fifth avenue and dropped
in to ask D., M. &amp; Co., how "Danny W.," was fareing
at the hands of their readers. He was told that five
readers had examined the story and that it was then in
the hands of the sixth! Some of the readers&mdash;and this
came to him privately&mdash;had turned in a favorable report.
Because of this, the author of "Danny W.," went back
to Brooklyn considerably elated. It would be an honor
indeed to have the book break through such a formidable
brigade of readers and get into the catalogue of the good
old house of Dodd, Mead &amp; Company.</p>

<p>The "highwayman" novelette was finished and submitted
in its complete form on Jan. 6. On the same day
Mr. White informed Edwards that he was well pleased
with the two chapters of "The Skirts of Chance" and
told him to proceed with it.</p>

<p>Fortune was on the upward trend for Edwards, and
he was sent for by Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, on Jan. 15,
and informed that they would either bring out "Danny
W.," on a royalty or pay a cash price for the book rights.
Edwards, remembering his disastrous publishing experience
with "A Tale of Two Towns," accepted $200 in
cash.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis bought the novelette for $125, and Harte
&amp; Perkins, on the same day, gave Edwards a new library
to do&mdash;35,000 words in each story at $50.</p>

<p>Complete manuscript of "The Skirts of Chance" was
submitted to Mr. White on Jan. 22, and on Jan. 27 Edwards
received $300 for it.</p>

<p>By Feb. 8 Edwards had written and sold to Mr.
Lewis another novelette entitled, "The Duke's Understudy,"
for which he received $140.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>On Feb. 9 he and his wife returned to Michigan.
Edwards had been in New York forty days and had
gathered in $965. He left New York with orders for
<i>Argosy</i> serials and with the new library, "Sea and
Shore," to be turned in at the rate of one story every
two months.</p>

<p>In May he was requested to go on with the Old Five-Cent
Library. These stories were forwarded regularly
one each week, until November, when orders were again
discontinued.</p>

<p>In September, "Danny W.," appeared. As with "A
Tale of Two Towns," the reviewers were more than
kind to "Danny W.," and there is just a possibility that
they killed him with kindness. The idea obtains, in supposedly
well-informed circles, that the only way for reviewers
to help a book is to damn it utterly. Be this as
it may, although illustrated in color and put out in the
best style of the book-maker's art, "Danny W.," did not
prove much of a success. A California paper bought
serial rights on the story for $50, and thus the book netted
the author, all told, the modest sum of $250.</p>

<p>During this year, also, The A. N. Kellogg Newspaper
Company sold serial rights on "Fate's Gamblers"
for $30, took 50 per cent. as a commission and presented
Edwards with what was left.</p>

<p>A short story, "The Camp Coyote," was sold to Mr.
Titherington, for <i>Munsey's</i>; and Edwards had opened
a new market in Street &amp; Smith's magazines. Thus was
brought to a close a fairly prosperous year.</p>

<p>In 1905 the returns slid backward a little. During
this year, and the year preceding, some stories which had
failed with Mr. White were received with favor by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Kerr, of <i>The Chicago Ledger</i>&mdash;at the <i>Ledger</i> price, ranging
from $30 upward to $75.</p>

<p>The <i>Woman's Home Companion</i>, to which Edwards
had vainly tried to sell serial rights on "Danny W.," accepted
a two-part story entitled, "The Redskin and the
Paper-Talk," and paid $200 for it. This is the story
of which a chapter was lost in the composing room, and
Edwards received an honorarium of $5 for having a
carbon duplicate of the few missing pages.</p>

<p>In 1905, also, The American Press Association did
business with Edwards to the amount of $30. Another
market for the Edwards' product&mdash;worth mentioning
even though the amount of business done was not large.</p>

<p>The returns for the two years were as follows:</p>

<p>Good, philosophical Ras Wilson once said to a new reporter,
"Young man, write as you feel, but try to feel
right. Be good humored toward every one and everything.
Believe that other folks are just as good as you
are, for they are. Give 'em your best and bear in mind
that God has sent them, in his wisdom, all the trouble
they need, and it is for you to scatter gladness and decent,
helpful things as you go. Don't be particular about
how the stuff will look in print, but let'er go. Some one
will understand. That is better than to write so dash
bing high, or so tarnashun deep, that no one understands.
Let'er go."</p>

<p>There was once a poor man hounded to death by
creditors. Ruin and suicide vied for his surrender.
But he was a man of the twentieth century, and flippantly
but with unbounded faith he collected a few
odd pennies and hied him to a newspaper office. Stopping
scarcely to frame his sentence he inserted a "want"
advertisement, stating his circumstances and declaring
he would commit suicide unless aid was proffered.
Within twenty-four hours he had $250; before another
sun his employer advanced as much more. Carefully
advising the newspaper to discontinue the advertisement,
he paid off his creditors&mdash;and lived happily ever
afterward! No, this is not a fairy tale. The time was
a few weeks ago, the city Chicago and the newspaper,
<i>The Tribune</i>. The moral is, that originality in writing,
coupled with a fresh idea, brings a check.</p></blockquote>

LOVE YOUR WORK<br />
FOR THE<br />
WORK'S SAKE<br />
</p>


<p>The sentiment which Edwards has tried to carry
through every paragraph and line of this book is this, that
"Writing is its own reward." His meaning is, that to the
writer the joy of the work is something infinitely higher,
finer and more satisfying than its pecuniary value to the
editor who buys it. Material success, of course, is a
necessity, unless&mdash;happy condition!&mdash;the writer has a
private income on which to draw for meeting the sordid
demands of life. But this also is true: A writer even
of modest talent will have material success in a direct
ratio with the joy he finds in his work!&mdash;Because, brother
of the pen, when one takes pleasure in an effort, then
that effort attracts merit inevitably. If any writing is
a merciless grind the result will show it&mdash;and the editor
will see it, and reject.</p>

<p>There are times, however, when doubt shakes the
firmest confidence. A writer will have moods into which
will creep a distrust of the work upon which he is at
that moment engaged. If necessity spurs him on and he
cannot rise above his misgivings, the story will testify to
the lack of faith, doubts will increase as defects multiply
and the story will be ruined. THE WRITER MUST
HAVE FAITH IN HIS WORK QUITE APART
FROM THE MONEY HE EXPECTS TO RECEIVE
FOR IT. If he has this faith he reaches toward a spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
success beside which the highest material success is
paltry indeed.</p>

<p>When a writer sits down to a story let him blind his
eyes to the financial returns, even though they may be
sorely needed. Let him forget that his wares are to be
offered for sale, and consider them as being wrought for
his own diversion. Let him say to himself, "I shall make
this the best story I have ever written; I shall weave my
soul into its warp and whether it sells or not I shall be
satisfied to know that I have put upon paper the BEST
that is in me." If he will do this, he will achieve a spiritual
success and&mdash;as surely as day follows night&mdash;a material
success beyond his fondest dreams. BUT he
must keep his eye single to the TRUE success and must
have no commerce in thought with what may come to
him materially.</p>

<p>To some, all this may appear too idealistic, too transcendental.
There are natures so worldly, perhaps even
among writers, as to scoff at the idea of spiritual success.
They are overshadowed by the Material, and
when the Spiritual, which is the true source of their
power, is no longer the "still, small voice" of their inspiration,
they will be bankrupt materially as well.</p>

<p>A writer cannot hide himself in his work. His individuality
is written into it, and he may be read between
the lines for what he is. A creation reflects the
creator, and that the work may be good the writer
should have spiritual ideals and do his utmost to live up
to them. Let him have a purpose, be it never so humble,
to benefit in some way his fellow-man, and let him hew
steadily to the line. Love your work for the work's
sake and material benefits "will be added unto you."</p>

<p>Years ago Edwards found an article in a newspaper
that appealed to him powerfully. He clipped it out, preserved
it and has made it of great help in his writing.
It is a wonderful "Doubt-destroyer." In the hope that
it may be an inspiration to others, he reproduces it here:</p>


<p class="center">STANDARDS OF SUCCESS.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At a time when material success is so generally regarded
as the chief goal of human effort it is interesting to find a
man in Professor Hadley's position presenting arguments for
a broader view of the question. In his baccalaureate sermon
the president of Yale offered the graduates some advice which
at least they should find stimulating. He does not discredit
or discourage the ambition for practical success but he makes
it plain that in his view there is danger in measuring success
in life "by the concrete results with which men can credit
themselves." "We should value life," he declares, "as a field
of action." We should care for the doing of things quite
as much as for the results. Tried by this standard, aspiration
and effort are to be more highly prized than achievement
itself. The man who sincerely strives for a great object has
succeeded, whether or not the object is attained or its attainment
brings any tangible reward.</p>

<p>It is no novelty, of course, to hear a college president upholding
ideal standards and rejecting utilitarian views of success,
but few of the educators have cared to follow their
theories, as President Hadley does, to their logical conclusion.
Probably a majority of them would applaud Nansen's
courage in attempting to reach the north pole but would question
the utility of the attempt. President Hadley admires
Nansen simply "because he succeeded in getting so much
nearer the pole than anybody before him ever did," and
thinks it is one of the most discouraging testimonies to the
false standards of the nineteenth century that Nansen feels
compelled to justify himself on the basis of the scientific results
of his expedition. Furthermore, a man who tries to get
to the pole is engaged in a glorious play, "which justifies more
risk and more expenditure of life than would be warranted for
a few miserable entomological specimens, however remote
from the place where they had previously been found."</p>

<p>The young man of to-day has no lack of exhortations to
lead the life of strenuous effort. It is as well that he should
be taught also that the reward for this effort will be barren if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the whole object sought be material benefit to himself. Life
is something to be used. Whether or not it has been successfully
used depends not on the results so much as on the object
sought and the earnestness of the seeking. It is somewhat
novel to find an American college president expounding this
philosophy to his students, but the philosophy is, on the whole,
helpful. It will spur to effort in crises where the desire for
more material success fails to provide a sufficient incentive.</p></blockquote>

<p>A certain New York author is fond of his own
work, and Robert W. Chambers is responsible for the
story that he called at one of the libraries to find out
how his latest book was going. He hoped to have his
vanity tickled a little.</p>

<p>"Is &mdash;&mdash; in?" he said to the librarian, naming
his book.</p>

<p>"It never was out," was the reply.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What is a great love of books? It is something like
a personal introduction to the great and good men of all
past times. Books, it is true, are silent as you see them
on your shelves; but, silent as they are, when I enter a
library I feel almost as if the dead were present, and
I know if I put questions to these books they will answer
me with all the faithfulness and fullness which
has been left in them by the great men who have left
the books with us.&mdash;<i>John Bright.</i></p>

<p>The spring poet has been much exploited in the comic
papers. The would-be novelist has been plastered with
signs and tokens until one could not fail to recognize
him in the dark. But the ordinary, commonplace, experienced
writer has been so shamefully neglected that
few realize his virtues. The editor recognizes his manuscript
as far off as he can see it, and seizes upon it with
joy. The manuscript is typewritten and punctuated.
It bears the author's name and address at the top of the
first page. It is signed with the author's name at the end.
It is NOT tied with a blue ribbon. No, the blue ribbon
habit is not a myth. It really exists in every form from
pale baby to navy No. 4 and in every shape from a hard
knot to an elaborate rosette&mdash;<i>Munsey's.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>
THE LENGTHENING<br />
LIST OF PATRONS<br />
</p>


<p>During the year 1906 the patrons of the Fiction Factory
steadily increased in number. <i>The Blue Book</i>, <i>The
Red Book</i>, <i>The Railroad Man's</i>, <i>The All-Story</i>, <i>The
People's</i>&mdash;all these magazines bought of the Factory's
products, some of them very liberally. The old patrons,
also, were retained, Harte &amp; Perkins taking a supply of
nickel novels and a Stella Edwards' serial for <i>The
Guest</i>.</p>

<p>Edwards' introduction to <i>The Blue Book</i> came so
late in the year that the business falls properly within
the affairs of 1907. The first step, however, was taken
on Aug. 13, 1906, and was in the form of the following
letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"My dear Mr. Edwards:<br />
</p>

<p>Why don't you send me, with a view to publication in <i>The
Blue Book</i>, as we have renamed our old <i>Monthly Story Magazine</i>,
one or more of those weird and fantastic novelettes of
yours? If you have anything ready, let me see it. I can at
least assure you of a prompt decision and equally prompt payment
if the story goes. Anything you may have up to 6,000
words I shall be very glad to see for <i>The Red Book</i>.</p>

<p class="sig2">
Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="sig1">"Karl Edwin Harriman."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Here was a pleasant surprise for Edwards. He had
met Mr. Harriman the year before in Battle Creek, Michigan.
At that time Mr. Harriman was busily engaged
hiding his talents under a bushel known as <i>The Pilgrim
Magazine</i>. When the Red Book Corporation of Chicago,
kicked the basket to one side, grabbed Mr. Harriman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
out from under it and made off with him, the aspect
of the heavens promised great things for literature
in the Middle West. And this promise, by the way, is
being splendidly fulfilled.</p>

<p>When you take down your "Who's Who" to look up
some personage sufficiently notorious to have a place
between its red covers, if you find at the end of his
name the words, "editor, author," you may be sure that
there is no cloud on the title that gives him a place in
the book. You will know at once that he must have
been a good author or he would never have been promoted
from the ranks; and having been a good author
he is certainly a better editor than if the case were
otherwise, for he knows both ends of the publishing
trade.</p>

<p>Having been through the mill himself, Mr Harriman
has a fellow-feeling for his contributors. He knows
what it is to take a lay figure for a plot, clothe it in
suitable language, cap it with a climax and put it on exhibition
with a card: "Here's a Peach! Grab me quick
for $9.99." Harriman's "peaches" never came back.
The author of "Ann Arbor Tales," "The Girl and the
Deal," and others has been successful right from the
start.</p>

<p>No request for material received at the Edwards'
Factory ever fails of a prompt and hearty response. A
short story and a novelette were at once put on the
stocks. They were constructed slowly, for Edwards
could give them attention only during odd moments
taken from his regular work. The short story was finished
and submitted long in advance of the novelette.
This letter, dated Sept. 18, will show its success:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My Dear Old Man: Why don't you run on here and see
me, now and again. Oh, yes, New York's a lot better, but
we're doing things here, too. About 'Cast Away by Contract,'
it's very funny&mdash;such a ridiculously absurd idea that
it's quite irresistible. How will $75 be for it? O. K.? It's
really all I can afford to pay for a story of its sort, and I do
want you in the book. Let me hear as soon as possible and I
will give it out to the artist.</p>

<p class="sig2">
Very truly yours,</p>
<p class="sig1">"K. H."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>And so began the business with Mr. Harriman. He
still, at this writing (1911), has a running account on the
Factory's books and is held in highest esteem by the
proprietor.</p>

<p>A letter, written May 13, 1905, (a year dealt with in
a previous chapter), is reproduced here as having a
weighty bearing on the events of 1906. It was Edwards'
first letter from a gentleman who had recently
allied himself with the Munsey publications. As a publisher
Mr. F. A. Munsey is conceded to be a star of the
first magnitude, but this genius is manifest in nothing
so much as in his ability to surround himself with men
capable of pushing his ideas to their highest achievement.
Such a man had been added to his editorial staff
in the person of Mr. R. H. Davis. Mr. Davis, like Mr.
Bryan, hails originally from Nebraska. Although he differs
somewhat from Mr. Bryan in political views, he has
the same powers as a spellbinder. He's Western, all
through, is "Bob" Davis, bluff, hearty and equally endowed
with stories, snap and sincerity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Dear Sir:<br />
</p>

<p>We would like to have a few pictures of those writers
who have contributed considerably to our various magazines.
It is obvious that this refers to you. Therefore, if you will
send us a portrait it will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p class="sig2">
Very truly yours,</p>
<p class="sig1">"R. H. Davis."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Davis got the picture; also a serial or two and
some short stories for new publications issued by the
Munsey Company of which he was editor. Late in
1905 he called for a railroad serial, and he wanted a
particularly good one.</p>

<p>Edwards had never tried his hand at such a story.
He knew, in a general way, that the "pilot" was on the
front end of a locomotive, and that the "tender" was
somewhere in the rear, but his technical knowledge was
hazy and unreliable. The story, if accepted, was to appear
in <i>The Railroad Man's Magazine</i>, would be read by
"railroaders" the country over, and would be damned
and laughed at if it contained any technical "breaks."</p>

<p>Here was just the sort of a nut Edwards liked to
crack. The perils of the undertaking lent it a zest, and
were a distinct aid to industry and inspiration. He resolved
that he would give Mr. Davis a story that would
bear the closest scrutiny of railroad men and win their
interest and applause. To this end he studied railroads,
up and down and across. He absorbed what he could
from books, and the rest he secured through personal
investigation. When the story was done, he submitted
the manuscript to a veteran of the rails&mdash;one who had
been both a telegraph operator and engineer&mdash;and this
gentleman had not a change to suggest! Mr. Davis took
the story aboard. While it was running in the magazine
a reader wrote in to declare that it must have been
written by an old hand at the railroad game: the author
of the letter had been railroading for thirty-five years
himself, and felt positive that he ought to know! "The
Red Light at Rawlines" scored a triumph, proving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
value of study, and the ability to adjust one's self to an
untried situation.</p>

<p>Edwards had imbibed too much technical knowledge
to exhaust it all on one story, so he wrote another and
sent it to Mr. White. The latter informed him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I turned 'Special One-Five-Three' over to <i>The Railroad
Man's Magazine</i> at once, without reading it, and they are
sending you a check for it this week, I understand. This
does not mean that I did not care to consider it for <i>The
Argosy</i>. I certainly have an opening for more of your stories,
but when you took the railroad for your theme and
treated it so intelligently, I think it better that you give <i>The
Argosy</i> some other subject matter."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another story, written this year to order, also serves
to show that facility in handling strange themes or environments
does not always depend upon personal acquaintance
with the subject in hand. Intelligent study
and investigation can many times, if not always, piece
out a lack of personal experience. Blazing a course
through <i>terra incognita</i> in such a manner, however, is
not without its dangers.</p>

<p>Harte &amp; Perkins wished to begin the yearly volume
of <i>The Guest</i> with a Stella Edwards serial. This story
was to have, for its background, the San Francisco earthquake.
Nearly the whole action of the yarn was to
take place in the city itself. Edwards had never been
there. He had vague ideas regarding the "Golden
Gate," Oakland and other places, but for accurate
knowledge he was as much at sea as in the case of the
railroad story. He set the wheels of industry to revolving,
however, and familiarized himself so thoroughly
with the city from books, newspapers and magazines
that the editor of <i>The Guest</i>, an old San Francisco
newspaper man, had this to say about the story:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It will please you to learn that we think 'A Romance of
the Earthquake' a very interesting story, with plenty of brisk
action, picturesque in description, and DISPLAYING A
THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF CALIFORNIA'S METROPOLIS
AND VICINITY."</p></blockquote>

<p>Although these are interesting problems to solve, yet
Edwards, as a rule, prefers dealing with material that
has formed a part of his own personal experiences.</p>

<p>His "prospecting" trip for the year brought him into
New York on Monday, Nov. 12. On Tuesday (his
"lucky day," according to the Coney Island seer of
fateful memory), he called on Mr. White, and Mr. White
took him across the hall and introduced him to Mr.
Davis. The latter gentleman ordered four serials and,
for stories of a certain length, agreed to pay $500 each.</p>

<p>Next day Edwards dropped in at the offices of
Street &amp; Smith and submitted a novelette&mdash;"The Billionaire's
Dilemma"&mdash;to Mr. MacLean, editor of <i>The Popular
Magazine</i> (Mr. Lewis having retired from that publication
some time before). Mr. MacLean carried the
manuscript in to Mr. Vivian M. Moses, editor of <i>People's</i>
and the latter bought it. This story made a hit
in the <i>People's</i> and won from Mr. George C. Smith,
of the firm, a personal letter of commendation. Result:
More work for <i>The People's Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>About the middle of December, Edwards and his
wife left for their home in Michigan. They had been
in the city a month, and during that time Edwards had
received $1150 for his Factory's products. The year,
financially, was the best Edwards had so far experienced;
but it was to be outdone by the year that followed.</p>

<p>During 1907 a great deal of writing was done for
Mr. Davis. Among other stories submitted to him was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
one which Edwards called, "On the Stroke of Four."
Regarding it Mr. Davis had expressed himself, May 6,
in characteristic vein:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"My dear Colonel:<br />
</p>

<p>Send it along. The title is not a bad one. I suppose it
will arrive at a quarter past five, as you are generally late....</p>

<p>Now that spring is here, go out and chop a few kindlings
against the canning of the fruit. This season we are going to
preserve every dam thing on the farm. In the meantime, put
up a few bartletts for little Willie. We may drop in provided
the nest contains room."</p></blockquote>

<p>He received an urgent invitation to "drop in." But
he didn't. He backed out. Possibly he was afraid he
would have to "pioneer it" in the country, after years
of metropolitan luxury in the effete East. Or perhaps
he was afraid that Edwards might read some
manuscripts to him. Whatever the cause, he never appeared
to claim the "bartletts," made ready for him with
so much painstaking care by Mrs. Edwards. But this
was not the only count in the indictment. He sent back
"On the Stroke of Four!" And this was his message:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Up to page 106 this story is a peach. After that it is a
peach, but a rotten peach, and I'd be glad to have you fix it
up and return it."</p></blockquote>

<p>After Edwards has finished a story he has an ingrained
dislike for tampering with it any further. However,
had he not been head over ears in other work, he
would probably have "fixed up" the manuscript for
Mr. Davis. In the circumstances, he decided to try its
fortunes elsewhere. Mr. Moses took it in, paid $400
for it, and pronounced it better than "The Billionaire's
Dilemma."</p>

<p>At a later date, Mr. Davis wanted another sea story
for <i>Ocean</i> which, at that time, was surging considerably.
"On the Stroke of Four" had been designed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
fill such an order. Inasmuch as it had failed, Edwards
wrote a second yarn which was accepted at $450.</p>

<p>The sea, and the people who go down to it in ships,
to say nothing of the ships themselves, were all out of
Edwards' usual line. He prepared himself by reading
every sea story he could lay hands on, long or short.
He bought text-books on seamanship and navigation, and
whenever there were manoeuvers connected with "working
ship" in a story, Edwards puzzled them out with the
help of the text-books. With both deep-water serials
he succeeded tolerably well. He is sure, at least, that
he didn't get the spanker-boom on the foremast, nor the
jib too far aft.</p>

<p>Harte &amp; Perkins again favored the Factory with an
order for a "Stella Edwards" to begin another volume
of <i>The Guest</i>. This was an automobile story, "The
Hero of the Car," and was accepted and highly praised.</p>

<p>Another novelette, "An Aerial Romance," was
bought by Mr. Moses for <i>The People's Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>Beginning in March, Edwards had written some
more nickel novels for Harte &amp; Perkins&mdash;not the old
Five-Cent Weekly, for that he was never to do again&mdash;but
various stories, in odd lots, to help out with a particular
series. On July 14 he was switched to another
line of half-dime fiction, and this work he kept throughout
the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>For the two years the Factory's showing stands as
follows:</p>

<p>In that remarkable group of authors who made the
dime novel famous, the late Col. Prentiss Ingraham was
one of the giants. These "ready writers" thought nothing
of turning out a thousand words of original matter
in an hour, in the days when the click of the typewriter
was unknown, and of keeping it up until a novel
of 70,000 words was easily finished in a week. But to
Col. Ingraham belongs the unique distinction of having
composed and written out a complete story of 35,000
words with a fountain pen, between breakfast and breakfast.
His equipment as a writer of stories for boys was
most varied and valuable, garnered from his experience
as an officer in the Confederate army, his service both
on shore and sea in the Cuban war for independence, and
in travels in Mexico, Austria, Greece and Africa. But
he is best known and will be most loyally remembered
for his Buffalo Bill tales, the number of which he himself
scarcely knew, and which possessed peculiar value
from his intimate personal friendship with Col. Cody.</p></blockquote>

<p>
A WRITER'S<br />
READING<br />
</p>


<p>That old Egyptian who put above the door of his
library these words, "Books are the Medicines of the
Soul," was wise indeed. But the Wise, ever since books
have been made, have harped on the advantage of good
literature, and have said all there is to be said on the
subject a thousand times over. If one has any doubts
on this point let him consult a dictionary of quotations.
No intelligent person disputes the value of books; and
it should be self-evident that no writer, whose business
is the making of books, will do so. To the writer books
are not only "medicines for the soul" but tonics for his
technique, febrifuges for his rhetorical fevers and prophylactics
for the thousand and one ills that beset his
calling. A wide course of general reading&mdash;the wider
the better&mdash;is part of the fictionist's necessary equipment;
and of even more importance is a specializing
along the lines of his craft.</p>

<p>"Omniverous reader" is an overworked term, but it
is perfect in its application to Edwards. From his youth
up he has devoured everything in the way of books
he could lay his hands on. The volumes came hap-hazard,
and the reading has been desultory and, for the most
part, without system. If engaged on a railroad story,
he reads railroad stories; if a tale of the sea claims his
attention, then his pabulum consists of sea-facts and fiction,
and so on. The latest novel is a passion with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and he would rather read a story by Jack London, or
Rex Beach, or W. J. Locke than eat or sleep&mdash;or write
something more humble although his very own. He is
fond of history, too, and among the essayists he loves
his Emerson. Nothing so puts his modest talents in a
glow as to bring them near the beacon lights of Genius.</p>

<p>Edwards has a library of goodly proportions, but it
is a hodge-podge of everything under the sun. Thomas
Carlyle "keeps company" with Mary Johnston on his
bookshelves, Marcus Aurelius rubs elbows with Frank
Spearman, "France in the Nineteenth Century" nestles
close to "The Mystery" from the firm of White &amp;
Adams, and four volumes of Thackeray are cheek by
jowl with Harland's "The Cardinal's Snuff-Box." A
most reprehensible method of book keeping, of course,
but to Edwards it is a delightful confusion. To him
the method is reprehensible only when he wants a certain
book and has to spend half a day looking for it.
Some time, some blessed time&mdash;he has promised himself
for years and years,&mdash;he will catalogue his books just as
he has catalogued his clippings.</p>

<p>Books that concern themselves with the writer's
trade are many, so many that they may be termed literally
an embarrassment of riches. If a writer had them
all he would have more than he needed or could use.
Books on the short story by J. Berg Eisenwein and
James Knapp Reeve, Edwards considers indispensable.
They are to be read many times and thoroughly mastered.
"Roget's Thesaurus" is a work which Edwards
consulted until it was dogeared and coverless; he then
presented it to an impecunious friend with a well-defined
case of <i>writeritis</i> and has since contented himself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the large "Thesaurus Dictionary of the English Language,"
by F. A. March, LL. D. This flanks him on
the left, as he sits at his typewriter, while Webster's
"Unabridged" closes him in on the right. The Standard
Dictionary is also within reach. Dozens and dozens of
books about writers and writing have been read and are
now gathering dust. After a writer has once charged
himself to the brim with "technique," he should cease
to bother about it. If he has read to some purpose his
work will be as near technical perfection as is necessary,
for unconsciously he will follow the canons of the art;
while if he loads and fires these "canons" too often,
they will be quite apt to burst and blow him into that innocuous
desuetude best described as "mechanical." He
should exercise all the freedom possible within legitimate
bounds, and so acquire individuality and "style"&mdash;whatever
that is.</p>

<p>No sane man in any line of trade or manufacturing
will attempt to do business without subscribing to one
or more papers or magazines covering his particular
field. He wants the newest labor-saving wrinkle, the
latest discoveries, tips on new markets, facts as to what
others in the same business are doing, and countless
other fresh and pertinent items which a good trade paper
will furnish. A writer is such a man, and he needs
tabulated facts as much as any other tradesman or manufacturer.
Periodicals dealing with the trade of authorship
are few, but they are helpful to a degree which it
is difficult to estimate.</p>

<p>From the beginning of his work Edwards has made
it a point to acquire every publication that dealt with
the business of his Fiction Factory. In early years he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
had <i>The Writer</i>, and then <i>The Author</i>. When these
went the way of good but unprofitable things, <span class="smcap">The
Editor</span> fortunately happened along, and proved incomparably
better in every detail.</p>

<p>From its initial number <span class="smcap">The Editor</span> has been a
monthly guest at the Factory, always cordially welcomed
and given a place of honor. Guide, counsellor and
friend&mdash;it has proved to be all these.</p>

<p>Edwards subscribes heartily to that benevolent policy
known as "the helping hand." Furthermore, he tries
to live up to it. What little success he has had with
his Fiction Factory he has won by his own unaided efforts;
but there were times, along at the beginning, when
he could have avoided disappointment and useless labor
if some one who knew had advised him. Realizing what
"the helping hand" might have done in his own case, he
has always felt the call to extend it to others. Assistance
is useless, however, if a would-be writer hasn't
something to say and doesn't know how to say it. Another
who has had some success may secure the novice
a considerate hearing, but from that on the matter lies
wholly with the novice himself. If he has it in him,
he will win; if he hasn't, he will fail. Edwards' first
advice to those who have sought his help has invariably
been this: "Subscribe to <span class="smcap">The Editor</span>." In nearly every
instance the advice has been taken, and with profitable
results.</p>

<p>This same advice is given here, should the reader
stand in need of a proper start along the thorny path
of authorship. Nor is it to be construed in any manner
as an advertisement. It is merely rendering justice
where justice is due, and is an honest tribute to a publication
for writers, drawn from an experience of twenty-two
years "in the ranks."</p>

<p>
NEW SOURCES<br />
OF PROFIT<br />
</p>


<p>The out-put of the Fiction Factory brought excellent
returns during the years 1908 and 1909. Industry followed
close on the heels of opportunity and the result
was more than gratifying. The 1908 product consisted
of forty-four nickel novels for Harte &amp; Perkins, two
novelettes for <i>The Blue Book</i>, four serials for the Munsey
publications, and one novelette for <i>The People's
Magazine</i>. This work alone would have carried the receipts
well above those of the preceding year, but new
and unexpected sources of profit helped to enlarge the
showing on the Factory's books.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which Edwards wrote his serial
stories&mdash;sometimes under the spur of an immediate demand
from his publishers, and sometimes under the less
relentless spur of personal necessity&mdash;seemed to preclude
the possibility of profit on a later publication "in cloth."
Only a finished performance is worthy of a durable
binding. Realizing this, Edwards had never made a determined
effort to interest book-publishers in the stories.
In the ordinary course of affairs, and with scarcely any
attention on his part, two serials found their way into
"cloth." "Danny W.," accepted and brought out by
Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., was written for book publication,
and serialized after it had appeared in that form. It
fell as far short of a "best seller" as did the two republished
serials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that additional profit
through publication in cloth seemed out of the question,
Edwards wondered if there were not something else
to be gained from the stories besides the serial rights.</p>

<p>His stories were dramatic and, in several instances,
had appealed to play-writers. For a time he had hopes
that dramatic rights might prove a source of additional
income. His hopes, in this respect, have not been completely
dashed, inasmuch as competent hands are at this
date (September, 1911) fitting some of his stories for
the stage. Something may come of it, but his experience
has made him wary and he is not at all sanguine.</p>

<p>Eliminating book and dramatic rights from the equation,
and what remained? A letter from Waltham,
Mass., dated April 23, 1908, uncovered possibilities of
which Edwards had never dreamed. Most of these possibilities,
as it transpired, <i>were</i> a dream, but, as in the
matter of dramatic rights, some day the dream may come
true in a large and substantial manner. Here is the
letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Dear Sir:<br />
</p>

<p>If you have not yet disposed of the sole and unrestricted
rights of translation into the GERMAN language of your books:
'The Billionaire's Dilemma' and 'The Shadow of the Unknown,'
will you permit me to submit them to my GERMAN correspondents&mdash;some
of the best known GERMAN PUBLISHERS&mdash;with
the idea of effecting a sale?</p>

<p>I shall require a single copy of 'The Billionaire's Dilemma,'
but not of 'The Shadow of the Unknown' having preserved the
story as it appeared first in the POPULAR,<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> to send abroad,
with a statement of the best terms you will make for the <i>cash
out-right purchase of both book and serial rights</i>.</p>

<p>If the serial rights of translation in GERMAN belong to
the POPULAR, you will have to come to a satisfactory understanding
with them, in order to legally assign to me the
SERIAL, as well as your own individual, book-rights, because
all GERMAN publishers insist on serial rights, although they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
seldom or never use them, as MAGAZINES are not good and
little used there.</p>

<p>My experience has been, that the MAGAZINE COMPANIES
are very broad in their treatment of their writers, and
usually willing to re-transfer their SERIAL rights of translation,
in order to facilitate a sale, and make them universally
known.</p>

<p>Of course less is paid for translation rights of stories that
have only appeared in SERIAL form in the STATES.</p>

<p>If any of the publishers I represent purchases your stories,
you have the best possible guarantee of perfect translation and
speedy publication.</p>

<p>Awaiting the courtesy of an early reply and the necessary
copy of 'The Billionaire's Dilemma,' I have the honor to be,
dear Sir,</p>

<p class="sig2">
Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="sig1">"Eugene Niemann."<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Several guns were fired during this invasion of Germany,
but only one shell "went home." This was not
the fault of Mr. Niemann. In Edwards' brief experience
with him he found him always a scholar and a gentleman.
Sincerity and courtesy were his never-failing
traits. The pleasant little twists he gave his English, and
the occasional naive expression that struggled through
his typewriter, along with the prodigal use of "caps,"
will perhaps excuse a further offering from the correspondence.
Here is the shot that hit the mark:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="date">
"May 12, 1908.</p>
<p>
"Dear Sir:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Before I have even had time to forward 'The Billionaire's
Dilemma' and 'On the Stroke of Four', and to await your other
announced stories, a letter comes from one of my German correspondents,
saying he had run through your short story: 'The
Shadow of the Unknown' and would purchase the rights of
translation if you will accept an offer of FORTY DOLLARS.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will say, "such an offer is absurd," but first
let me state to you, that the best books placed in GERMANY
bring at the most ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS, and oftener
anywhere from FIFTY to ONE HUNDRED, that the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
profit, is not a monetary one, rather the spreading of the writer's
name and fame.</p>

<p>'The Shadow of the Unknown,' writes the publisher, is a
very short story, and if you will be guided by my long experience,
dear Sir, you will accept the offer, in order to make our
name popular and facilitate a better sale of your following stories,
which I shall take double pleasure in forwarding, feeling
surer of a good offer.</p>

<p>Were I guilty of business indiscretion, you would be surprised
to know the names of the already published 'BOOKS' I
have sold and am daily selling the GERMAN rights of, for
hardly a monetary consideration at all, and yet the literary satisfaction
quite out-balances all other considerations, does it not?</p>

<p>I enclose the customary form of assignment, which you can
sign and have duly witnessed by a NOTARY PUBLIC, if you
see fit to accept the offer, and which you will please then send
me per AMERICAN EXPRESS C. O. D. subject to examination
to avoid every possible chance of error.</p>

<p>The personal receipt need not be signed before the NOTARY
PUBLIC, your signature without witness suffices.</p>

<p>Hoping to do much better for you with your other fine stories
and appreciating your confidence, I remain, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="sig2">
Very truly yours,</p>
<p class="sig1">"EUGENE NIEMANN."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>After the dust had settled, and the invasion was finally
completed, $40 had been added to the year's receipts
of the Fiction Factory; but Edwards clings to the hope
that some day more of his "fine stories" may be greedily
bought by the German publishers. These German
publishers are honorable enough to buy, where they
might pirate, and there are a few American publishers
who might take lessons from them in business probity.
With a small tidbit from a letter of May 18, the pleasant
Mr. Niemann will be dismissed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Later, with your permission, I will take up the stories I sell
in GERMANY for sale in FRANCE, DENMARK, NORWAY
and SWEDEN?</p>

<p>The monetary remuneration in the SCANDINAVIAN countries
is yet smaller than in GERMANY, but the people are fine
readers, and that for all, who truly LOVE their ART is the
chief standpoint I take it?!"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>During the latter part of July and the earlier part of
August Edwards was in New York for a couple of
weeks. As usual when in the city he worked even harder
than he did at home. Two nickel novels were written,
a serial was put through the Factory for Mr. Davis,
and he collected $200 for a novelette which he sold to
<i>People's</i>. There was an interesting, almost a humorous,
circumstance connected with the serial.</p>

<p>Edwards called the story "The Man Who Left."
When the manuscript was completed he took it in to Mr.
Davis, and two or three days later called again to learn
its fate.</p>

<p>The Munsey offices are up close to the roof in the
Flatiron building. The lair of the editor who presides
over the destinies of <i>The All-Story Magazine</i>, <i>The Railroad
Man's Magazine</i> and <i>The Scrap Book</i><a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> is flanked on
one side by a prospect of space that causes the occasional
caller to hang on to his chair. Across from this dizzy
void is a partition hung with framed photographs of contributors&mdash;a
rogues' gallery in which Edwards, when he
last saw the collection, had a prominent place. North of
an imaginary line drawn between the window and the
partition sits the editor, grimly prominent against a motto-covered
wall. As the caller faces the editor he is, of
course, confronted by placards reminding him that "This
is My Busy Day&mdash;Cut it Short," and "Find A Man for
the Job not A Job for the Man," and others cunningly
calculated to put him on tenterhooks.</p>

<p>To this place, therefore, came Edwards, proffering
inquiries about "The Man Who Left." He read fateful
things in the august countenance, and he was not surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
when Mr. Davis handed him a lemon, but he <i>was</i>
surprised when he took the lemon back.</p>

<p>"Rotten," said Mr. Davis, "r-r-rotten! When I'm
out for peaches, Edwards, I side-step the under-ripe persimmons.
'The Man Who Left' ought to have made his
get-away along about line one, paragraph one, chapter
one; and then if he had staid out plumb to the place
where you have written 'Finis' this gorgeous but unconvincing
tale would have been vastly improved. Am I a
Jasper that you seek thus to inveigle me into purchasing
a gold-brick? Here, take it away! Now let me have
it again. I am going to give you three hundred for it
and tuck it away in the strong-box. Later you are to
evolve, write and otherwise put upon paper a fictional
prize for which 'The Man Who Left' will be returned to
you in even exchange. Do you get me? 'Nuff said. I
think you're out of mazuma, and that's why I'm doing
this. My friends'll ruin me yet!"</p>

<p>Now the humor, if there is any, fits in about here:
Edwards went back to Michigan and wrote a serial which
he sent on to replace "The Man Who Left." Here is
the letter in reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
My dear Edwards:<br />
</p>

<p>While I was away on my vacation, some one spilled a pitcher
of milk. In other words, they put "The Man Who Left"
to press for <i>The All-Story Magazine</i>, and it is now too late to
yank it back. That's the trouble of leaving anything in the
safe that should not be there. You and I, however, being
practical men, can understand the facility with which the yarn
was nabbed up.</p>

<p>Now, the point is, I can use the "Mydus" yarn and get a
check off to you next week, provided I have some basis on
which to operate. What's the lowest price for which you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
give me 'Mydus,' call all previous arrangements equal, and let
things stand as they are. The way to trim me and square accounts
is to come back with a quick, short, sharp, cheap reply,
and let it go at that.</p>

<p>Hurry up this 'Mydus' business and we'll see what we can
do.</p>

<p class="sig2">
Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="sig1">"R. H. DAVIS."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The spilling of that "pitcher of milk" while Mr.
Davis was away on his vacation had netted Edwards
just an even $300.</p>

<p>Another source of profit from the serial stories which
the Fiction Factory had been turning out for years was
revealed to Edwards in a letter dated Nov. 19, 1908.
This, like the matter of translation rights, came to Edwards
as a pleasant surprise; but, unlike the "German
invasion," it was to prove vastly more profitable. Here
is the letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Dear Sir:<br />
</p>

<p>Upon looking over the files of <i>The Argosy</i> we find that you
have written the following serial stories. Are the book rights
of these your property? If not, can you get Mr. Munsey to
give them to you? If you can, and will lengthen the stories to
about 75,000 words, we will pay you $100 each for the paper
book rights of same.</p>

<p>We cannot offer you more, as we would put these out in
cheap paper edition, but this publication would do a great deal
toward popularizing your name and work with the class of
readers who buy <i>The Argosy</i> and other fiction magazines.</p>

<p>The stories are as follows: (Here were listed the titles of
seven <i>Argosy</i> serials.)</p>

<p class="sig2">
Very truly yours,</p>
<p class="sig1">"STREET &amp; SMITH."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Edwards caught at this opportunity. He failed to
realize, at the time, just how much work was involved
in lengthening the stories for paper-book publication. In
his reply to Street &amp; Smith he offered a list of forty-five
serials, and promised others if they could use so
many. He was requested, on Dec. 4, to forward copies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of all the stories for reading. The same letter contained
this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I note that your letter is dated December 2nd and that you
state you expect to be in New York inside of three weeks. I
think it might be to our mutual advantage if you could come
on in a week or ten days, for there is a new line of work which
I think you could do for us about which I would like to talk
with you."</p></blockquote>

<p>Just before Christmas Edwards and his wife arrived
in New York. On some of the serials which had appeared
in the Munsey magazines Edwards owned all but
serial rights, but there were many more wherein all
rights were held by the publishers.</p>

<p>The folly of a writer's selling all rights when disposing
of a story for serial publication dawned upon Edwards
very strongly, at this time. The conviction was
driven "home" at a little dinner which Edwards tendered
to several editors and readers. During the course of
the dinner one of the guests&mdash;an editor in charge of a
prominent and popular magazine&mdash;averred bluntly that
"any writer who sells all rights to a story to a magazine
using the story serially, is a fool."</p>

<p>With Edwards this sale of all rights had resulted
from carelessness more than anything else, and had he
not been dealing with friends like Mr. White and Mr.
Davis he might have suffered financial loss because of
his folly. Two or three interviews with Mr. Davis secured
the paper-book rights, but with the understanding
that if any of the lengthened stories were brought out
in cloth, one-half of the royalties were to go to The Munsey
Company.</p>

<p>In the whole list there were only seven stories long
enough for immediate issue in paper-book form. These
were paid for, at once. The other stories fell short of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the required number of words all the way from 5,000 to
30,000 words. There was no profit to Edwards in
lengthening the stories at the price of $100 each. What
benefit he derived&mdash;and is now deriving, for the work
continues&mdash;was in the advertising which the wide circulation
of the paper-covered books afforded him. Also,
Edwards considered the value of cementing his friendship
with the old-established publishing house of Street
&amp; Smith, a house noted for the fairness of its dealings
with contributors and for the prompt payment for all
material upon acceptance. "Making good" with publishers
of such high standing is always of inestimable
value to a writer.</p>

<p>One of Street &amp; Smith's editors, at this time, was St.
George Rathborne, author of "Dr. Jack" and dozens of
other popular stories that have appeared in paper covers.
Here was another author who had become an editor,
bringing to his duties an experience and ability that made
for the highest success. Mr. C. A. MacLean, another member
of the Street &amp; Smith editorial staff, was also a gentleman
with whom Edwards had occasional dealings. Mr.
MacLean, beginning at the lowest rung of the ladder, had
mounted steadily to the post of editor of <i>The Popular
Magazine</i> and <i>Smith's Magazine</i>, by sheer force of his
own merit pushing those publications to the forefront of
magazines of their class. To these gentlemen, and particularly
to Mr. Rathborne,<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> Edwards is indebted for
unfailing kindness and courtesy, and takes this means to
acknowledge it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>The special work which was mentioned in Street &amp;
Smith's letter of Nov. 19 consisted of a new weekly
publication for which Edwards was to furnish the copy.
Seventy-five dollars each was to be paid for these
stories.</p>

<p>With all this work ahead of the Fiction Factory, the
year 1909 dawned in a blaze of prosperity. During
1909 Edwards found himself so busy with the paper-books
and the other publication that he had no time for
serial stories. After thirty-four issues the new publication
was discontinued, and Edwards went back to writing
novels for Harte &amp; Perkins, at $60 each.</p>

<p>During 1909 Edwards tried his hand at moving pictures.
The alluring advertisements under the scare-head,
"We Pay $10 to $100 for Picture Plays," caught
his eye and fired his ambition. He wrote a scenario,
sent it in, and waited expectantly for his $100. He had
been only two hours preparing the "photoplay" and it
looked like "easy money." When the check arrived it
was for $10! He wrote in to ask what had become of
the remaining $90? Thus answered The Vitagraph
Company of America, Oct. 27, '09:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In regard to the payment for a manuscript of this character,
we never give more than ten dollars, for two or three reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place, we only use the idea. The manuscript has
to be revised in almost every instance in order to put it in
practical shape for the directors.</p>

<p>Again, they contain an idea which is more or less stereotyped
or conventional and cannot be claimed as entirely original only
as applied to the action of the play.</p>

<p>Regarding your own idea, I will frankly say that the same
idea has often been embodied in other plays, but the general suggestion
of it gives a new phase to the action of the idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Editor</span> merely surmises, or so we think, that a
thoroughly original manuscript in practical shape would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
worth at least $25, but we seldom get one of that kind. We
would welcome one at any time and would pay its full value.</p>

<p>The members of our staff, who are obliged to write practical
working scenarios, appreciate the above facts because they know
what it means to perfect a scenario with the synopsis of the
story, the properties, settings, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>We merely state these things so you will understand that we
are thoroughly fair in your case and will certainly be so in
every instance.</p>

<p>Ideas, if they are entirely original, would be worth more
than ten dollars, but they are scarcer than hen's teeth at any
price.</p>

<p>We find most of the ideas which we receive, and we receive
hundreds of them, are nothing but repetition or old ones in new
guises.</p>

<p>Again we will say, if we can get original ideas we will pay
their full value."</p></blockquote>

<p>O. Henry told a whimsical tale of what he considered
unfair competition in the short story field. He was in
the office of a big magazine, when he witnessed the return
to a dejected looking young fellow of a couple of
manuscripts. "I am sorry for that fellow," said the
editor. "He came to New York from New Orleans a
year ago, and regularly brings some stories to our
office. We can never use them. He doesn't make a dollar
by his pen, and he is getting shabby and pale."
A month or so later O. Henry saw the same writer in
the same office, and the editor was talking to him
earnestly. "You had better go back to New Orleans,"
said that gentleman. "Why?" said the young man.
"Some day I may write a story you may want." "But
you can do that just as well in New Orleans," said the
editor, "and you can save board bills." "Board bills,"
ejaculated the young man. "What do I care about
board bills! I have an income of twenty thousand a
year from my father's estate."</p></blockquote>

<p>
THE INJUSTICE<br />
OF IT<br />
</p>


<p>The commercial world may hearken sentimentally to
that plaintive ballad, "Silver Threads Among the Gold,"
as it floats into the Emporium from a street organ, but
the commercial world never allows sentiment to interfere
with business. When a man presents himself and
asks for a job, he is examined for symptoms of decrepitude
before his mental abilities are canvassed. The wise
seeker for place, before making the rounds of the Want
Column, will see to it that his hair is of a youthful color,
for there is nothing so damned by the octopus of trade
as hoary locks. A bottle of walnut juice, carefully administered,
may bridge the gap and lead from failure to
success.</p>

<p>"New blood!" that's the cry. "Age is too conservative,
too partial to the old and outworn standards, too
apt to keep in a rut. Give us the mop of black hair and
the bright, snappy eye! Give us energy and brilliant
daring and a fresh view-point! We'll be taking a few
chances, but what of that? We must follow the
fashion."</p>

<p>Some of the publishers have gone to the extreme of
the prevailing mode. The yearling from the football
field, if he happens to have been sporting editor of the
college journal, is brought to the sanctum, shoved into
the chair of authority, and given $50 a week and the
power to go ahead and be ruthless. He rarely disappoints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
his employer. Whenever he does, his employer
is to be congratulated. Usually, however, he sticks to
his schedule. He thinks he is Somebody, and attempts
to prove it by kicking all the old contributors out of the
office and forwarding invitations for manuscripts to
every member of the Class of '10.</p>

<p>There is no writer of experience who has failed to
meet this sort of editor. For years a publishing house
may have steadily increased in power and prestige
through the loyalty and labor of the old contributor, only
to give some darling of the campus a desk and the authority
to begin oslerizing faithfulness and ability.</p>

<p>This injustice would be humorous were some of its
aspects not so tragic. The smug publishers themselves
may have something to answer for. They have wrung
their ratings in Dun and Bradstreet from the old contributor,
and when they abandon a policy that has brought
success they are steering through troubled waters and
into unknown seas.</p>

<p>For anything short of incompetence this casting
aside of the old in order to try out the new is reprehensible.
To weather a decade or two of storm and stress
a writer must have been versatile. Versatility increases
with his years, and he is as capable of brilliant daring
and a fresh viewpoint as any youth in the twenties.</p>

<p>Times out of number this has been made manifest.
Stories disguised with a pen-name and a strange typewriter
have won welcome and success where the old
name and the old typewriter would have insured rejection.
Note this from one who has been twenty-five
years at the game:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the near-humorous line I may mention the fact that
I once tried to get the editor of a certain paper to let me
furnish him a serial, but he didn't think I could write it. Soon
afterward a friend who had been contributing serials to that
particular paper was asked by the editor to furnish a serial.
As it chanced, the writer happened to be engaged in other work.
So he came to me and wanted to know if I could not write the
desired serial. When I informed him that the editor had
turned my offer down, he then suggested that I write the serial
and let him send it in under his own name. It was a chance to
try the sagacity of that particular editor. I salved my conscience,
wrote the serial, and my typewritten copy was submitted
to the editor under the name of my friend. The serial was
accepted, with medals thrown all over it&mdash;my literary friend
being informed that it was just the thing the editor wanted,
and that he had hard work to get authors who could suit his
view as to what was available for his particular publication.
My friend got the honor, if there was any, of seeing the serial
run under his name; and I got the money for doing the work."</p></blockquote>

<p>If an author ever suffers an editor's contempt, what
must the editor suffer on being caught red-handed in
such a way as this? It is the worm's prerogative to
turn whenever it finds the opportunity.</p>

<p>Illustrating this point, and several other points with
which this chapter is concerned, the following letter
from another writer, who has been turning out successful
manuscripts for upward of twenty years, is reproduced:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Dear Bro. Edwards:<br />
</p>

<p>You certainly DO put a poser to me. At the present time
I have difficulty in seeing anything that has happened to me
in the twenty-odd years of my following the literary game in
anything but a tragic light. I believe my success, such as it
was, was tragic. At least, it has rivetted my reputation to a
certain class of literature&mdash;heaven save the mark!&mdash;and makes
it almost impossible for me to sell anything of a better quality.
I might tell you of plenty of cruel things that have been done
to me by publishers and editors when they knew or suspected
that I was hard up; and plenty of silly things done to me by
the same folk when they thought I didn't particularly NEED
their money. But funny things&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>It's the point of view makes the thing funny. The child
pulling the wings off a fly to see the insect crawl over the
window pane is amused; but I don't suppose the fly sees
the humor of the situation. I could tell you tales of submitting
the same manuscript three times to an editor whom we
both know well, having it shot through with criticism the first
two times and then having it accepted and paid for at extra
rates within two years of the first submission, and without even
a word of the title changed! Is THAT the kind of an incident
you want?</p>

<p>One of the funniest things that ever happened to me was
that an editor of a popular magazine used to say that my stuff
resembled Dickens, and when I wrote half-dime novels the
readers used to write in and say the same. The quality of mind
possessed by the scholarly editor and the street boys who read
'Bowery Billy' must be somewhat the same&mdash;eh?</p>

<p>There was once a magazine that bore as its title the name
of a publisher as famous as any American ever saw, and the
editor bought a story of me at the rate of half a cent a word,
and owed me two years for it. Finally, one time when I was
very hard up I went to the office and hung around until I could
see the 'boss' and put it up to him to pay me. He did. He
knocked off 33 1-3 per cent for 'cash.' Pretty good, eh?</p>

<p>I tell you, Edwards, there's nothing funny in the game that
I can see&mdash;not for the so-called literary worker. The gods may
laugh when they see a man with that brand of insanity on him
that actually forces him to write. But I doubt if the writer
laughs&mdash;not even if he writes a 'best seller.' For success entails
turning out other successes, and that is hard work. Excuse
me! I am going back to the farm. I will write only when
I have to, and only as long as my farm will not support me.
I've got hold of a pretty good place cheap, down here with the
outlook of making a good living on it in time. No more the
Great White Way, with the Dirty Black Alley behind it, in
mine! I am not going to carry my hat in my hand around to
editors' offices and take up collections for long. Besides, most
of the editors blooming now are just out of college and are
not dry behind the ears yet. They think that Johnny Go-bang,
who edited the sporting page in the Podunk University
Screamer, knows more about writing fiction than the old fellows
who have been at it a couple of decades. And I reckon
they are right. They are looking for 'fresh' material; some of
it is pretty 'raw' as well as fresh. I fooled an editor the other
day by sending a manuscript on strange paper, written on a
new typewriter, and with an assumed name attached. Sold the
story and got a long letter of encouragement from the editor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Great game&mdash;encouraging 'new' writers! About on a par with
the scheme some rum sellers have of washing their sidewalks
with the dregs of beer kegs. The spider and fly game. Now,
if I told that editor what an ass he had made of himself, would
he ever buy another manuscript of me again? I fear not!</p>

<p>Perhaps I am pessimistic, Brother Edwards. There's no real
fun in the writing game&mdash;not for the writer, at least. Not
when he is forty years old and knows that already he is a 'has-been.'
Good luck to you. Hope your book is a success, and if
I really knew just what you wanted I'd try to whip something
into shape for you. For you very well know that, if other fiction
writers give you incidents for your book, they'll mostly be
fiction! That is the devil of it. If a fiction writer cuts a
sliver off his thumb while paring the corned beef for dinner,
he will make out of the story a gory combat between his hero
and a horde of enemies, and give details of the carnage fit to
make his own soul shudder.</p>

<p>I hope to meet up with you again some time. But pretty
soon when I go to New York I'll wear my chin-whiskers long
and carry a carpet-bag; and you bet I'll fight shy of editors'
offices."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another example of injustice to writers which, however,
happened to turn out well for the writer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I offered a short serial to a certain newspaper syndicate.
Soon I received a letter saying they could pay me $200 for the
serial rights. Before my letter accepting the offer reached
them, I had another letter from the syndicate withdrawing the
offer. The editor stated pathetically that the proprietor had returned
and had asked him to withdraw it. I then sent the serial
to a Chicago newspaper, which paid me $200 for serial rights&mdash;BUT
NEVER PUBLISHED THE STORY. Finally I rewrote
the story, had it published as a book by a leading Eastern
publishing house, and it sold well."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, again, is injustice of another kind:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Once a certain Eastern magazine authorized me to go to
Santa Fe, New Mexico, and write a description of a Pueblo
dance and of Pueblo life, and send the manuscript on with
photographs for illustration. I did the work. And I was rewarded
by the generous editor with a check for $20! You can
imagine how profitable that particular stunt was, for I took
a week's time and paid my own expenses. But not out of that
twenty. There wasn't enough of it to go 'round."</p></blockquote>

<p>
WHAT SHALL<br />
WE DO<br />
WITH IT?<br />
</p>


<p>Edwards wrote only one serial story during 1910,
and turned his hand to that merely to bring up the financial
returns and leave a safe margin for expenses.
Nickel novels, a few short stories, a novelette for <i>The
Blue Book</i> and the lengthening of two stories for paper-book
publication comprised the year's work. He "soldiered"
a little, but when a writer "soldiers" he is not
necessarily idle. Edwards' thoughts were busy, and the
burden of his reflections was this: Heaven had endowed
him with a small gift of plot and counter-plot, and a
little art for getting it into commercial form; but were
his meager talents producing for him all that they
should? Was the purely commercial aim, although
held to with a strong sense of moral responsibility, the
correct aim? After a score of years of hard work did
he find himself progressing in any but a financial direction?
Forgetting the past and facing the future with
eyes fixed at a higher angle, how was he to proceed with
his "little gift of words?" What should he do with it?</p>

<p>In the bright summer afternoons Edwards would
walk out of his Fiction Factory and make a survey of it
from various points. He was always so close to his
work that he lost the true perspective. He was familiar
with the minutiae, the thousand and one little details
that went to make up the whole, but how did it look in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the "all-together," stripped of sentiment and beheld in
its three dimensions?</p>

<p>Paradoxically, the work appeared too commercial in
some of its aspects, and not commercial enough in others.
The sordid values were due to the demand which
came to Edwards constantly and unsolicited, and which
it was his unvarying policy always to meet. "All's fish
that comes to the writer's net" was a saying of Edwards'
that had cozzened his judgment. He was giving
his best to work whose very nature kept him to a dead
level of mediocrity. And within the last few years he
had become unpleasantly aware that at least one editor
believed him incapable of better things. This was largely
Edwards' fault. Orders for material along the same
old lines poured in upon him and he hesitated to break
away from them and try out his literary wings.</p>

<p>Years before he had faced a similar question. The
same principal of breaking away from something that
was reasonably sure and regular for something else not
so sure but which glowed with brighter possibilities, was
involved. Vaguely he felt the call. He was forty-four,
and had left behind him twenty-odd years of hard and
conscientious effort. As he was getting on in years so
should he be getting on with some of his dreams, before
the light failed and the Fiction Factory grew dark and
all dreaming and doing were at an end.</p>

<p>One evening in Christmas week, 1910, he mentioned
his aspirations to a noted editor with whom he happened
to be at dinner. The book that was to bring fame and
fortune, the book Edwards had always been going to
write but had never been able to find the time, was under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
discussion. "Write it," advised the noted one,
"but not under your own name."</p>

<p>Edwards fell silent. What was there in the work
he had done which made it impossible to put "John Milton
Edwards" on the title page of his most ambitious
effort? Were the nickel novels and the popular paper-backs
to rise in judgment against him? He could not
think so then, and he does not think so now.</p>

<p>"Why don't you write up your experiences as an
author?" inquired the editor a few moments later.
"You want to be helpful, eh? Well, there's your
chance. Writers would not be the only ones to welcome
such a book, and if you did it fairly well it ought
to make a hit."</p>

<p>This suggestion Edwards adopted. Having the
courage of convictions directly opposed to the noted
editor's, the other one he will not accept.</p>

<p>The reflections of 1910 began to bear fruit in 1911.
With the beginning of the present year Edwards gave
up the five-cent fiction, not because&mdash;as already stated
in a previous chapter&mdash;he considered it debasing to his
"art," but because he needed time for the working out
of a few of his dreams.</p>

<p>Presently, as though to confirm him in his determination,
two publishing houses of high standing requested
novels to be issued with their imprint. He accepted both
commissions, and at this writing the work is well advanced.
If he fails of material success in either or both
these undertakings, by the standards elsewhere quoted
and in which he thoroughly believes, the higher success
that cannot be separated from faithful effort will yet
be his. And it will suffice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Even in 1910 Edwards had been swayed by his
growing convictions. Almost unconsciously he had begun
shaping his work along the line of higher achievement.
During 1911 he has been hewing to the same
line, but more consistently.</p>

<p>Edwards has demonstrated his ability to write moving
picture scenarios that will sell. But is the game
worth the candle? Is it pleasant for an author to see
his cherished Western idea worked out with painted
white men for Indians and painted buttes for a background?
Of course, there are photoplays enacted on the
Southwestern deserts, with real cowboys and red men
for "supers," but somewhere in most of these performances
a false note is struck. One who knows the West
has little trouble in detecting it.</p>

<p>This, however, is a matter of sentiment, alone. The
nebulous ideas most scenario editors seem to have as to
rates of payment, and the usually long delay in passing
upon a "script," are important details of quite another
sort. And, furthermore, it is unjust to throw a creditable
production upon the screen without placing the
author's name under the title. Of right, this advertising
belongs to the author and should not be denied him.</p>

<p>In 1910 a moving picture concern secured a concession
for taking pictures with Buffalo Bill's Wild West
and Pawnee Bill's Far East Show, and Edwards was
hired to furnish scenarios at $35 each. He furnished a
good many, and of one of them Major Lillie (Pawnee
Bill) wrote from Butte, Montana, on Sep. 2;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Friend Edwards:<br />
</p>

<p>I saw one of the films run off at a picture house a few
days ago and I think they are the greatest Western scenes that
I have ever witnesed&mdash;that is, they are the truest to life. I had
a letter from Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; yesterday, and he thinks they are fine.</p>

<p class="sig2">
Your friend,</p>
<p class="sig1">G. W. Lillie."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>For a time Edwards thought his faith in the moving
picture makers was about to be justified. But he was
mistaken. He received a check for just $25, which
probably escaped from the film men in an unguarded
moment, and no further check, letter or word has since
come from the company. The proprietors of the Show
had nothing to do with the picture people, and regretted,
though they could not help the loss Edwards had suffered.</p>

<p>When the moving picture writers are assured of better
prices for their scenarios, of having them passed
upon more promptly and of getting their names on the
films with their pictures, the business will have been
shaken down to a more commendable basis. Possibly
the film manufacturers borrow their ideas of equitable
treatment for the writer from some of the publishing
houses.</p>

<p>The "hack" writer, in many editorial offices, is
looked down upon with something like contempt by the
august personage who condescends to buy his "stuff"
and to pay him good money for it. Perhaps the "hack"
is at fault and has placed himself in an unfavorable
light. Writers are many and competition is keen.
Among these humble ones there are those who have suffered
rebuff after rebuff until the spirit is broken and
pride is killed, and they go cringing to an editor and
supplicate him for an assignment. Or they write him:
"For God's sake do not turn down this story! It is the
bread-line for me, if you do."</p>

<p>Did you ever walk through the ante-room of a big
publishing house on the day checks are signed and given
out? Men with pinched faces and ragged clothes sit in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the mahogany chairs. They have missed the high mark
in their calling. They had high ambitions once&mdash;but
ambitions are always high when hope is young. They
are writing now, not because they love their work but
because it is the only work they know, and they must
keep at it or starve (perhaps <i>and</i> starve).</p>

<p>A taxicab flings madly up to the door in front, and a
stylishly clad gentleman floats in at the hall door and
across the ante-room to the girl at the desk. They exchange
pleasant greetings and the girl punches a button
that communicates with the private office of the powers
that be.</p>

<p>"Mr. Oswald Hamilton Brezee to see Mr. Skinner."</p>

<p>Delighted mumblings by Mr. Skinner come faintly to
the ears of the lowly ones. The girl turns away from
the 'phone.</p>

<p>"Go right in, Mr. Brezee." she says. "Mr. Skinner
will see you at once."</p>

<p>Mr. Brezee's "stuff" has caught on. Dozens of
magazines are clamoring for it. Mr. Brezee vanishes
and presently reappears, tucking away his check with
the careless manner of one to whom checks are more or
less of a bore. He passes into the hall, and in a moment
the "taxi" is heard bearing him away.</p>

<p>The lowly ones twist in their chairs and bitterness
floods their hearts. Like the author of "Childe Harold,"
Brezee awoke one morning to find himself famous.
These others, with the dingy Windsor ties and the long
hair and pinched faces never awake to anything but a
doubt as to where the morning meal is to come from.</p>

<p>After hours of waiting in the ante-room, checks are
finally produced and passed around to the lowly ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
and they fade away into the haunts that know them best.
Next pay-day they will be back again, if they are alive
and have been given anything to do in the meantime.</p>

<p>Is <i>this</i> game worth the candle? What shall these
men do with their "little gift" but keep it grinding, merciless
though the grind may be? They cannot all be Oswald
Hamilton Brezees.</p>

<p>Before a young man throws himself into the ranks
of this vast army of writers, let him ponder the situation
well. If, under the iron heel of adversity, he is
sure he can still love his work for the work's sake and
be true to himself, there is one chance in ten that he
will make a fair living, and one chance in a hundred
that he may become one of the generals.</p>

<p>The Factory returns for 1910 and for part of 1911
are given below. Edwards believes that, in its last
analysis, 1911 will offer figures close to the ten-thousand
dollar mark&mdash;but it is a guess hedged around with
many contingencies.</p>

<blockquote class="bbox">

<p>George Ade asked an actress, who was one of the original
cast of "The County Chairman," to whom he had
just been introduced, "Which would you rather be&mdash;a literary
man or a burglar?" It is related that the actress,
who was probably as excited as Ade, answered, "What's
the difference?" And this is supposed to be a humorous
anecdote!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The man who tells stories, sometimes fiction and
sometimes stories, about the Harper publications, evolves
the following realistic story about "The Masquerader,"
originally published in <i>The Bazaar</i>. Well, it seems that
one morning, the editor sat her down and found the
following letter, which is truly pathetic and possibly
pathetically true: "You may, and I hope you have, some
little remembrance of my name. But this will be the
very oddest letter you have ever received. I am reading
that most clever and wonderfully well-written novel,
'The Masquerader.' I have very serious heart trouble
and may live years and may die any minute. I should
deeply regret going without knowing the general end
of that story. May I know it? Will be as close as the
grave itself if I may. I really feel that I may not live
to know the unravelling of that net. If I may know for
reason good and sufficient to yourself and by no means
necessary to explain, may I please have the numbers as
they come to you, and in advance of general delivery?"
The editor sent on the balance of the story, but it was
never revealed whether it made the person well again
or not. Edwards imagines that the whirl of action in
books would not be good for the heart&mdash;or, for the matter
of that, the soul.</p></blockquote>

EXTRACTS<br />
GRAVE AND GAY,<br />
WISE AND OTHERWISE<br />
</p>


<p>Cigars on the Editor:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The berth check came to me this morning. I suppose the
cigars are on me. At the same time, there is another kind of
check which you get when you buy your Pullman accomodation
at the Pullman office in the station. It was that which I
had in mind. I suppose the one you enclosed is the conductor's
check. I don't believe I ever saw one before."</p></blockquote>

<p>How "Bob" Davis hands you a Lemon:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first six or seven chapters of 'Hammerton's Vase'
are very lively and readable&mdash;after which it falls off the shelf
and is badly shattered. Everybody in the yarn is pretty much
of a sucker, and the situations are more or less of a class. I
think, John, that there is too much talk in this story. Your
last thirty pages are nothing but.</p>

<p>What struck me most was the ease with which you might
have wound the story up in any one of several places without
in anyway injuring it. That is not like the old John Milton of
yore. You used to pile surprise upon surprise, and tie knot
after knot in your complications. But you didn't do it in
'Hammerton's Vase'&mdash;for which reason I shed tears and return
the manuscript by express."</p></blockquote>

<p>How Mr. White does it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am very sorry to be obliged to make an adverse report
on 'The Gods of Tlaloc.' For one thing the story is too wildly
improbable, for another the hero is too stupid, and worse than
all the interest is of too scrappy a nature&mdash;not cumulative.
You have done too good work for The Argosy in the past for
me to content myself with this.... When I return Aug. 9, I
shall hope to find a corking fine story from your pen awaiting
my perusal. I am sure you know how to turn out such a
yarn."</p></blockquote>

<p>A tip regarding "Dual-identity":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The story opens well, and that is the best I can say for it.
I put up the scheme to Mr. Davis and he expressed a strong
disinclination for any kind of a dual-identity story."&mdash;Matthew
White, Jr.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>How Mr. Davis takes over the Right Stuff:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We are taking the sea story. Will report on the other
stuff you have here in a day or two. In the meantime, remember
that you owe me an 80,000-word story and that you are
getting the maximum rate and handing me the minimum
amount of words. You raised the tariff and I stood for it
and it is up to you to make good some of your threats to play
ball according to Hoyle. It is your turn to get in the box and
bat 'em over the club-house. And remember, I am always on
the bleachers, waiting to cheer at the right time."</p></blockquote>

<p>How Mr. White lands on it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Helping Columbus' pleases me very much, and on our
principle of paying for quality I am sending you for it our
check for $350."</p></blockquote>

<p>During the earlier years of his writing Edwards
made use of an automatic word-counter which he attached
to his Caligraph&mdash;the machine he was using at
that time. He discovered that if a story called for
30,000 words, and he allowed the counter to register
that number, the copy would over-run about 5,000 words.
At a much later period he discovered by actual comparisons
of typewritten with printed matter just the number
of words each page of manuscript would average in the
composing-room. From his publishers, however, he
once received the following instructions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To enable you to calculate the number of words to write
each week, we make the following suggestions: Type off a
LONG paragraph from a page of one of the weeklies that has
been set solid, so that the number of words in each line will
correspond with the same line in print.</p>

<p>When you have finished the paragraph you can get the
average length of the typed line as written on your machine,
and by setting your bell guard at this average length you will
be able to fairly approximate, line for line, manuscript and
printed story.</p>

<p>A complete story should contain 3,000 lines. Calculating in
this way, you will be able to turn in each week a story of
about the right length. Our experience shows us that the
calculated length of a story based on a roughly estimated number
of words usually falls short of our requirements, and although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to proceed in the manner suggested above may involve
a little extra work&mdash;not above half an hour at the outside and
on one occasion only&mdash;by it alone are we convinced that you
will strike the right number of words for each issue."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Along the Highway of Explanations":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I cannot see 'The Yellow Streak' quite clear enough. You
whoop it up pretty well for about three-quarters of the story,
and then it begins to go to pieces along the highway of explanations."&mdash;Mr.
Davis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Concerning the "Rights" of a Story:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Unless it is otherwise stipulated, WE BUY ALL MANUSCRIPTS
WITH FULL COPYRIGHT."&mdash;F. A. Munsey Co.</p></blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The signing of the receipt places all rights in the hands of
the Frank A. Munsey Company, but they will be glad to permit
you to make a stage version of your story, only stipulating that
in case you succeed in getting it produced, they should receive
a reasonable share of the royalties."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Last Word on the Subject:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. White has turned over to me your letter of October
12, as I usually answer letters relating to questions of copyright.
I think, under the circumstances, if you want to dramatize
the story we ought to permit you to do so without payment
to us. The only condition we would make would be that
if you get the play produced, you should print a line on the program
saying,&mdash;'Dramatized from a story published in <i>The
Argosy</i>,' or words to that effect."&mdash;Mr. Titherington, of <i>Munsey's</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Paragraphing, Politics and Puns:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your paragraphs are pretty good, so far. But SHUN
POLITICS AND RELIGION in any form, direct or indirect,
as you would shun the devil. And please don't pun&mdash;it is so
cheap."&mdash;Mr. A. A. Mosley, of <i>The Detroit Free Press</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Climaxes, Snap and Spontaneity:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We don't like to let this go back to you, and only do so
in the hope that you can let us have it again. The sketch is
capitally considered, the character is excellent, the way in
which it is written admirable, the whole story is very funny,
and yet somehow it does not quite come off. The climax&mdash;the
denouement&mdash;seems somewhat labored and lacks snaps and
spontaneity. Can't you devise some other termination&mdash;something
with more 'go?' This is so good we want it to be better."&mdash;Editor
<i>Puck</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>Novelty and Exhilarating Effect:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have no special subject to suggest for a serial, but
would cheerfully read any you think desirable for our needs.
The better plan always is to submit the first two installments of
about four columns each. Novelty and exhilarating effect are
desirable."&mdash;Editor <i>Saturday Night</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Saddling and Bridling Pegasus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We are very much in need of a short Xmas poem&mdash;from
16 to 20 lines&mdash;to be used at once. Knowing your ability and
willingness to accomodate at short notice, I write you to ask if
you can get one to us by Saturday of this week, or Monday at
latest. I know it is a very short time in which to saddle and
bridle Pegasus, but I am sure you can do it with celerity if
any one can."&mdash;Editor <i>The Ladies' World</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Carrying the Thing too Far:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We regret that we cannot make use of 'The Brand of
Cain,' after your prompt response to our call, but the title and
story are JUST A LITTLE BIT too sensational for our
paper, and we think it best to return it to you. It is a good
story and well written, but we get SO MUCH condemnation
from our subscribers, often for a trifle, that we are obliged
to be very careful. Only a week or two ago we were severely
censured because a recipe in Household Dep't called for a
tablespoonful of wine in a pudding sauce, and the influence of
the writer against the paper promised if the offense were repeated."&mdash;From
the editor of a woman's journal.</p></blockquote>

<p>And, finally, this from Mr. Davis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We are of the non-complaining species, ourself, and aim
only to please the mob. Rush the sea story. If it isn't right,
I'll rush it back, by express.... Believe, sir, that I am personally
disposed to regard you as a better white man than the
average white man because you a larger white man, and,
damnitsir, I wish you good luck."</p></blockquote>

PATRONS AND<br />
PROFITS FOR<br />
TWENTY-TWO YEARS<br />
</p>


<p>On the 20th of this month (September, 1911) it will
be just twenty-two years since Edwards received payment
for his first story. On Sept. 20, 1889, <i>The Detroit
Free Press</i> sent him a check for $8. On that $8
the Fiction Factory was started.</p>

<p>Who have been the patrons of the Factory for these
twenty-two years, and what have been the returns?</p>

<p>A vast amount of work has been necessary in order
to formulate exact answers to these questions. Papers
and other memoranda bearing upon the subject were
widely scattered. During Edwards' travels about the
country many letters and records were lost. The list
that follows, therefore, is incomplete, but exact as far
as it goes. More work was realized upon, by several
thousands of dollars, than is here shown. For every
item in the record Edwards has a letter, or a printed slip
that accompanied the check, as his authority. The errors
are merely those of omission.</p>

<p>Titles of the material sold will not be given, but following
the name of the publication that purchased the
material will be found the year in which it was either
published or paid for.</p>

<p>The finest music in the room is that which streams
out to the ear of the spirit in many an exquisite strain
from the hanging shelf of books on the opposite wall.
Every volume there is an instrument which some melodist
of the mind created and set vibrating with music, as a
flower shakes out its perfume or a star shakes out its
light. Only listen, and they soothe all care, as though the
silken-soft leaves of poppies had been made vocal and
poured into the ear.&mdash;<i>James Lane Allen.</i></p>

<p>When William Dean Howells occupied an editorial
chair in Harper's office, a young man of humble and
rough exterior one day submitted personally to him a
poem. Mr. Howells asked:</p>

<p>"Did you write this poem yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Do you like it?" the youth asked.</p>

<p>"I think it is magnificent," said Mr. Howells. "Did
you compose it unaided?"</p>

<p>"I certainly did," said the young man firmly. "I
wrote every line of it out of my head."</p>

<p>Mr. Howells rose and said:</p>

<p>"Then, Lord Byron, I am very glad to meet you.
I was under the impression that you died a good many
years ago."</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="THE_EDITOR" id="THE_EDITOR">THE EDITOR</a></h2>


<p>If you write, or if you have
an itching to write, we want
to talk to you.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Editor</span>, we may explain,
is "The Journal Of Information
For Literary Workers."
It is not at all pretentious,
and not at all dull. It is a
matter-of-fact little magazine,
always filled with good, readable
articles on the technique
of writing. Sometimes they
are contributed by authors and
sometimes by editors.</p>

<p>We aim to show our patrons,
so far as such things
may be taught, how to write
fiction, poetry, articles and the
like, and then how to sell
them, provided they are up to
the standard demanded by
editors. We have been assured
so many times that it
wearies us, that our magazine
has been the lever that pried
open the editorial doors of
pretty nearly every publication
in the country. In addition to
our articles we present our
Literary Market department
in which we list monthly the
complete report of editorial
needs, announcements, policies,
changes, prize-contests, etc.
This enables the writer to
keep his finger on the magazine
pulse; he knows what to
write, when to write it, how to
write it, when to submit it,
what payment will be made,
and countless other points.
Authors such as George Allan
England, who is selling regularly
to <i>McClure's</i>, <i>Red Book</i>,
<i>Bohemian</i>, etc., have been
good enough to say that this
department alone is worth the
subscription price. Now add
to the foregoing a spice of
good verse, bright editorial
comment, and you'll know why
every editor and very nearly
every author of note sends his
writer-friends to us.</p>

<p>Why you can't write and do
without the authors' trade-journal!
You will always
find something between the
covers of the magazine that
drives you to work, that spurs
you to greater efforts, that
puts you on the high road to
success.</p>

<p>We pride ourselves on the
fact that <span class="smcap">The Editor</span> is a
good, live text-book. It is a
pretty sort of a teacher, you
know, who never sees an educational
journal; new methods
and systems are cropping out
constantly. And no writer&mdash;we
leave this to you&mdash;likes to
send a manuscript to a magazine
that suspended a few
months ago; nor allow an article
to go unread that may
cover just the point on which
his or her rejections cling.
The writer wants hints, helps,
and as many of them as possible;
everybody does. There
is no magazine that better
meets this want than <span class="smcap">The
Editor</span>.</p>

<p>We've succeeded in pleasing
and making famous the promising
writer-folk of this country
since 1894. Mayn't we
have you?</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
